1. It must have a fireplace. (It does, it was damaged in the Northridge earthquake but it is fixable.)

2. It must be in a neighborhood that goes hard for holidays, particularly Halloween. Because I intended to be *that house.* The one with the full-size candy bars that's happy to see you and loves all your costumes and *oh my goodness look at the cute Spider-Man, T-rex, 80s boombox, and Chinese takeout carton!* ""oh, look, honey, it's Carmen Sandiego, Travis Kelce, a tomato, and a whole Valhalla of Vikings!"" *::dumps giant handfuls of candy in pillowcases::*

We moved in on October 22, 2023. I sent a text to the neighborhood text thread I had recently been added to, asking about how much candy I should stock. I was assured that no matter how much I bought, it wouldn't be enough.

Reader, what I heard was *✨️showtime.✨️*

My door cracked open at 6 for the littles, and by 7, it was pandemonium until 8:30 and then it dropped off. We had about three boxes and a big bag of the Wonka fun sizes left. 

I bought about the same amount last year, and we were cleared out by 9. The neighborhood also had about double the traffic we did the year prior. My neighbor joked that word must have gotten around that the gingerbread-looking house on 20th had full-size candy bars, so our neighborhood became the must-stop destination. I shot back, ""Mission Accomplished.""

This year, year three, things are a little different. We were both laid off right after we bought the house, thanks to the tech industry/tariff bloodbath and we are unlikely to survive it as homeowners -- we're out of runway and options and we are likely to be in foreclosure before the end of the year. But I still have a little money left, not a lot, but enough to stock twice what I had last year, and I am asking my neighbors to do the same.

* First up I like to talk to them for a long time before I actually meet them. I am a texter so we need to go on well through text if it's gonna work.

I prefer coffee dates for a first date because:

* They're in public crowded places
* It leaved it open to end it quickly if things go wrong (you don't have to sit through a whole meal or worse a three course meal) but it also leaves it open for you to plan another activity and/or moving on to a restaurant if all goes well. Usually I have something planned like I looked up a movie in a nearby cinema or found an event happening on that day so that I don't show up completely empty handed
* You don't waste a lot of money on a bad date (I like to pay for myself, but I also don't feel too bad if they insist on paying and I don't want to see them again)

For the early stages of going on dates:

* Under no circumstances are they allowed to know where  I live until I would actually want them to show up in my home uninvited.
* Only go on the early dates while on my period

If I wasn't pretty confident about my Judo skills, embarrassed to let anyone know I'm going on a date, and had people who cared I would also let someone know where I'm going and with whom, and have check-ins throughout the day/night.

I didn't hear about it before I met my fiancé, but if he regrets his life decisions and I find myself single again I am definitely demanding an STD test and (relevant for the country I live in) proof of not being married and living with the people they say they do before I'm in a relationship and get intimate with them (I don't have intimacy with people I'm not in a relationship with, not judging just my personal preference due to being demi). I am getting myself and my fiancé tested too. It's just good hygiene to do when the tests are as cheap and available as they are today.

I’m very loyal and monogamous. I can have guy friends but nothing romantic. It depends on who I’m with and if he’s seeing more than one woman. Some men are capable of making you feel like the only woman in his life—meaning decent attention, like you’re not missing anything. And somehow make you feel secure even in a Polyamory situation, and some the opposite. 

I don’t wanna see him with someone else. I don’t wanna see him dump me or hurt me for another woman. Been there and it killed me. I can’t do it. Seeing him show up for another woman. Give love and affection. Show care. Tell them he misses them or is happy to see them or happy to spend time with them. He can have another date with someone else but I don’t wanna have my heartbroken like that in front of my face. 


For me the biggest trigger is the other women themselves. If she rubs it in my face or boasts about seeing him or sabotages his time with me. That triggers all the devils living at the bottom pit of my Hades and they come erupting like bats out of hell.

The biggest problem in a situation like this is in case it’s another woman taking advantage of you. Meaning it becomes a competition, or he is incapable of hiding his affection which ultimately shows if it’s more towards one person than another. 

It’s expected that even in a normal relationship with two people someone will love more than the other person. And in a Polyamory situation in my case it was obvious how much he cared about one woman more than me. 

It hurt me immensely. She’s known him for a decade and knows how he ticks. I don’t. Everything is new to me. Showing up during a time when me and another friend had plans with him. Deliberately sabotaging his time consistently to intimidate you. Posts stories about her love life with him to rub it in your face. Shit like this I can’t tolerate. 

For me I’m very private and discrete. I don’t share anything about the person I’m with. And if there’s another person I would never rub it in their faces. Never did it once.

She doesn't respect any boundaries that anyone us trying to set, she's also a big time hypocrite and I just don't respect that about her. She is also prone to exaggerating, lying and playing the victim, she also always discredits your pain because of X Y Z that happened to her in her life and obviously she had it worse. And since she retired few years ago, the phrase she uses a lot is ""I've worked my lot in life, I'm done with everything"" as if retiring from a job automatically strips her of the social responsibility of being a decent human and family member and it's supposed to excuse her shitty behaviour. And one of me and my sister's favourites, which she has told me she heard her say behind our backs ""I bought this home. And the other one too, it's my money, I should be able to do whatever I want"" in regards to us having rules in our homes that she doesn't ever respect. Nobody asked her to ""buy"" us homes. And it's not ""her money"", it's both her and my dad. He is the one with the much higher salary. And she forced us to be listed as the home owners in the property's documents upon buying. 

Recently she stayed over at mine as I was hosting my teenage niece and she was looking after her as I was away on vacation. I had kindly reminded her that there is to be no smoking in my home any longer as I'm pregnant and the effects of second hand smoke still affect my child and as non-smokers, me and my husband don't tolerate this in our home. She scoffed and said she never planned to. I also reminded her to not move around my things qnd rearrange my house. My niece not only reported that she was smoking inside and not even opening the windows, but she also took liberty to rearrange my house and she ruined a lot of mugs and other things that I valued by relentlessly scrubbing them with a metal scrubber. When I confronted her she denied and said my niece lied and that I'm imagining things and I'm being ruthless towards her and I need to stop. She had also ""cleaned my house because it was dirty"" and that was the justification for the rearrangement. I informed her before my trip that I stayed up all night and deep cleaned. I didn't sleep and nearly missed my flight. She ended up very upset because I was enforcing boundaries when I called her from abroad that she wanted to leave immediately with my niece and just abandon my pets without care and didn't even feel remorse when I told her if I can't find anyone to watch after them I'd have to change my tickets and fly back. I was in Paris and about to get engaged and she was okay with ruining that for me because she just hates it when things are not done her way and she has to respect other people. 

She reluctantly took our dog and I was lucky to find a sitter for our cats, but of course I was blamed for not making better plans and having her take care ""once again"". Oh you see I did have plans arranged. They fell through because 1 - there were going to be 2 people in my house at all times and askibg someone else to come take care of the pets was unreasonable. And 2 - I was going to spare her the chore of looking after our dog by taking him to my husband's family in another city. Very unfortunately our car broke down enough for us to not consider it safe to drive such a long way and good thing we didn't, because the car repair garage said we could have literally caught on fire mid-drive. Yet my own mother wasn't too concerned about me nor the fact I'm carrying a child. It's just inconvenience for her and it's my fault.

So yes, it's complicated because I recently feel genuine hate for her and wish she would be better or ideally, work on herself and her traumas and stop ruining our lives. Alas, I'm not considering not involving her in my child's life at all, that needs to be earned, she hasn't and I don't think she can.",10,2025-10-21,08:59:45,0,0.995770871639252,1,"anger",0.996549367904663,0

To answer your question it would really have to depend on his life circumstances relative to mine.  I'm an old woman but I'm not very progessive in my career so a lot of people in my industry make more than me.  I also happen to have a mortgage so my cash availability is not a lot ... plus I have a very expensive hobby so I pretty much divert everything I earn to it and am therefore not cash rich.  I cannot afford fancy dinners at michelin places or travel abroad but I'm relatively ok.

Most of my peers would be able to afford trips abroad and do go abroad.  Some paid off their mortgages so they are very comfortable.  I have a friend who makes what I do or less but he's way richer than me beause he has a lot of other investments and ventures that earn him other income.  Even though he complains he's only renting a studio apartment, it's a studio because he has to live near the beach whereas my place is not near a beach so more affordable!

If I'm just going out with someone I probably don't care but as long as we can have a comfortable and decent meal and time, it's all that matters.  However I do travel a lot for my hobby and if it's someone long term, he may not be able to keep up if he cannot afford to travel or he's not keen on spending his money on it.

And as I mentioned, I'm old.  This means I'm used to certain levels of comforts so if I ever do travel, I'm not hacking it in a hostel with 24/7 music or sharing bathrooms with 10 other people; I would pay to have my own room but on the other hand I don't indulge in pedicures or manicures or facials.  I think I'd be more concerned with someone who could afford to keep up with my lifestyle than how much he makes.  I have another friend who doesn't work at all but he just has money since his apartment was bought over by a developer and he gained some cash in that transaction.

If someone comes from a very different background than yours it becomes a little difficult to relate to each other. It’s not a deal breaker but it can be uncomfortable. 

Example—sharing what you do and how you live can intimate the person who earns less. The person who earns less might feel incapable of providing a similar lifestyle to the person who earns mor and could break their confidence. They think they need to match the lifestyle. 

For me personally I value the way they ethically spend more than how much. So it’s more of a turn off for me when a guy tries to compensate by showing off their wealth or they use money unethically (stealing, dishonesty, gambling, etc) more than not being able to match salaries. 

It’s more attractive to be hardworking and passionate. I’ve got a few examples in my family where amazing men married into some of my distant cousins with very comfortable lifestyles and they ended up being very happy. The guy is so loving and supportive and hardworking. They ended up supporting each other and growing. It’s so inspiring to watch honestly. 

And I have other examples in my family where a very rich guy married a girl who’s well off but not like him. And his family never really got around to accepting her or liking her. It caused a lot of tension but they made it work.

It felt like a triumph. Everything we had worked for, getting to be together, be intimate, just hold hands or go grocery shopping together. It was bliss. 

Then reality set in. 

I was 900 miles away from everyone I knew and loved. I had no support system or friends outside of him. Every friend I did try to make, he sabotaged the relationship. I'm not and probably will never be sure, but I think maybe that was a positive for him, like he wanted it that way or he saw the situation and took advantage of it even if he didn't design it that way. 

He slowly isolated me from the world. I couldn't even talk on the phone to my family without him present. He wouldn't let me drive or work. He made me totally dependent on him, and then blamed me and held that over my head, which just furthered the whole cycle. 

We ended up getting married mostly so I could have health insurance, which, to be fai,r did save my life, but it just got worse from there and a lot of other bad shit happened before and after we split, but I'm free now and I would never move to be with someone again. 

I won't say to someone not to do it, because every situation is different and my ex was abusive, and I want to believe that's not the norm. 

BUT I will say if you want to move to be with someone because of a LDR, protect your independence. Make sure you are financially stable on your own, can stand on your own two feet, and establish a life for yourself outside of your partner when you get there.

I would work late and noticed the front door light will always be left on even when she was the kind to always turn the lights off and lock up. I would also turn off the TV playing rain noises (which she would turn on and leave to help fall asleep) via the Apple home app as I got ready for bed (I knew she would be asleep and waking up in the morning with constant noise would give her more of a headache).

Though we ended things and we were no longer together I understood that though our love had fundamentally changed, it was and probably will still be there in some form.

I stopped doing that as I realized putting more thought into that wasn't helping me heal for myself. But I never stopped caring.

Extending that I also understood that love can exist in so many different forms and it continues to change, always. That story I shared about my ex was just one shade of infinite kinds.

He had that chronic pink skin thing (can't spell it) and cystic acne. I did a natural look on him to cover the redness and acne and contoured his face. He loved how he looked and it just clicked for him! He actually felt really bummed that he ""couldn't"" wear make up because he felt so much more confident with just an even skin tone and less obvious acne. He loved the contour that made him feel more masculine. He noticed that he immediately sat up straighter and smiled more when he saw this version of him. That's what make up can do for a lot of people

Makeup is also just another way to express yourself--no different from hair or clothing. Hair cuts aren't natural. Clothing is natural. But we all engage in those no problem. Sometimes I enjoy loud make up and clothes. Sometimes I prefer to blend in. Sometimes I prioritize comfort. I do what makes me feel good in that moment, and if you don't like it, don't date me.

Poems and songs and art have been created for centuries to try to capture the depth and complexity of holding your new baby or laughing until you cry with your best friend or sitting by your mother's side for the last time.

If it was new or recentish relationships, then I think I could do it. Politically, I'm down. Logistically... who has the time (in my age group, 40s)??

Speaking from where I am, 17 years in to a relationship - there's no way I'd be keen to have another person, not as a third (all three of us in a relationship together), and I'm even less keen on either of us having separate relationships with others.

As boring as it sounds, this is mostly around logistics, fairness, and the sort of ""family"" bond that happens over time and changes things. 

Sorting out things like family obligations, what do we do when a parent needs to move in or we need to travel and support them? How do we support each other through the seriously hard stuff, like if someone gets seriously ill, or becomes disabled, or needs serious support in some other way? It's easy to say, ""we'll just make it work"", but I can't see a way that it doesn't end up competitive or unfair, having lovely new relationship energy on one side, and family-bonded difficult intimacy on the other.  And at the most basic level, splitting your time would be tough, especially for those working long hours, running businesses and/or caring for kids or others.

I think that imbalance - a long relationship between two people, then newer ones with others - seems like it would create a hierarchy on the one hand (""old"" partner having supremacy, just logistically even if not on purpose), or the ""old"" partner feeling like they need to compete for being exciting, fun, cool, sexy etc.",66,2025-11-11,08:59:26,0,0.999050080776215,2,"joy",0.985056459903717,1

I fell in love with the little things he did for me that showed me how much he cared. I loved the high regard he had for me. The loving way he used to stare at me. The high importance he had for me. I felt it so strongly. I felt I was someone’s “high value” thing. It made me feel loved and cherished. Made me feel so confident and beautiful in someone’s eyes. 

And then I experienced the complete opposite where he did everything to crush me and make me feel so worthless in comparison to everyone else. 

I get to hear him boast about other women and point out how amazing they are at a time when he was pushing me away and telling me he doesn’t give a shit about me. 

The biggest lesson is him showing me the difference between how it feels to be treated like a man’s treasure and treated like trash. 

The second lesson is not knowing how to let him go because I was terrified of losing him. I stayed even when I knew he didn’t care and held on so strongly. 

The moment he showed me he didn’t care anymore I should have walked away months ago 💔 but I couldn’t imagine life without him after feeling so happy. 

Big lesson—doesn’t matter how much you love someone or want things to workout. Once they check out, it’s over. You’ll end up always trying so hard and it’s never enough in their eyes. 

They’ll only see flaws or how annoying you are. But when it’s the opposite, and someone cares about you—they’ll always see the beautiful sides in you, no matter how ugly you get or how challenging things get. That’s how I loved him.",86,2025-10-23,06:52:47,0,0.99866795539856,8,"sadness",0.969994783401489,0

A very famous writer of my home country died a decade ago. He was known to be an absent father and philanderer and abusive husband. His children have spoken up different times here and there but were very negatively received because people worship this writer. His wife has always been tight lipped. His wife has become active on social media since Covid and she is also an amazing narrator. 3-4 days ago she wrote a status about how her husband threw her outside of the house in the middle of the night in freezing temperature. She kept knocking the door but he didn’t open. She realized she would freeze and die soon, so she ran to the closest store. It was closed but she rang the bell. She was wearing a shirt, pants, and flip flops. The store owner lived upstairs, they opened the door and took her in. They asked if she wanted to call the police. She said no I have to go home. They looked at her weird and gave her a jacket. She went home later as if nothing happened. Their child who was a toddler then (it was the 70s), was crying and crying. They never talked about it as if nothing happens but she’s grateful things like this didn’t happen in her children’s lives. 

This is a very prominent writer and filmmaker she was talking about. The whole nation has a parasocial relationship with him even after so many years of his death. They are not ready to mix art with artists. They say his wife shouldn’t have put this on the social media when he cannot defend himself. The hate this woman got on social media last 4 days is something I’ve never seen. Facebook eventually took down the status because of mass reporting. 

This post was very triggering for me as if I couldn’t breathe. I cried so much next 2 days. I just couldn’t stop.

We met 11 years ago on the internet because I bought a pair of discontinued leggings from her in a B/S/S group. We had both sought them out for our respective trips to Ireland. We kept in touch after that and a few years later she coincidentally moved a few hours away from me about 7 years ago so we met for the first time. We both moved away within 2 years. 

We’re both now childless cat ladies in our 30s. I can count on two hands the number of times I have seen my best friend in person. We don’t talk every day. But I can say without a doubt that this is the most important person in my life. 

Twice now (in one year, no less) I’ve told her that I would be performing in my pole dance studio’s showcase. This isn’t a major competition or a big stage; this is dancing in a room for 50 people. Without prompting, without question, she has said “and I will be there.” She flew across the country to watch me dance for 5 minutes, twice. And she cried with joy for me both times. 

She is my biggest supporter, the ultimate hype woman. She knows my biggest hurts and deepest insecurities and even though she is far away from me, I know that no matter what she is right there by my side, cheering me on.

"669",669,669,"AskWomen","KeyCompetitive4022","1otywl4","How do you break up with someone?",29,1,23,"Boo-Boo-Bean","no8xxff","
I’m the person who someone broke up with because I’m emotional, (not aggressive), but he felt I wasn’t good for him—too stressful, a handful, and insecure. 

Maybe it helps to give you my perspective (from the opposite side). 

I know I’m emotional. I know he’s busy and I can see how my insecurities made him feel uncomfortable. Like he’s walking on eggshells and he has to be careful. If I see him with another woman I get triggered and I sulk or I get in a bad mood. It makes him feel like he can’t be himself around me. He loves his space and freedom. He felt me being emotional and wanting him to speak to me more, connect with me more—rubbed him the wrong way. 

I never defended how emotional I was or insecure. I asked for what I needed—more validation, but timing and his limited time and someone else he’s more comfortable with all got in the way of me and him possibly finding a compromise to make things work. 

When I felt him change and distance himself I knew I was losing him and it terrified me. And this part is important—it triggered me more (especially for an anxious attachment person). 

My biggest fear was losing what I had with him after waiting a lifetime to meet someone like that who I was able to love that way. But the more he distanced himself, the more I was insecure and triggered. 

In his defense he was so overwhelmed. He didn’t know how to tell me it’s over. He made excuses. He kept silent. He gave me what I wanted to hear on a superficial level while depriving me access to himself and our connection. 

At the same time I see him connecting with other women and that was emotionally BRUTAL for me. 

The more he withdrew, the more I felt triggered and the more I felt triggered the bad sides of me showed and confirmed his judgment and resolution to distance himself. 

It was a horrible cycle. And the more advantage someone else he cared about was having seeing me pushed aside. 

Moral of the story: DONT DO IT THIS WAY. 

Break ups are painful. Someone is going to get hurt no matter what. It IS personal. But not being honest and fading or ghosting or withdrawing is going to make it ten times more painful 💔 

When I knew it was over with him, all I really wanted was comfort, knowing it was ending on good terms. I couldn’t get that at the time because I was just getting more and more negative and it bought the worst sides in me. And I can see his disappointment. 

It’s your right to change your feelings and end things, but you also owe it to someone you initially liked that may not be currently on the same wavelength as you to know how you feel exactly. They gave you their time, and possibly connected to you on an intimate level. It’s not cool to just shut someone out when you decide to walk away. 

Be honest and transparent. 
“I saw potential in us being together but I don’t feel happy at the moment” 

If you like many aspects of her except for the emotional side, then try to communicate that if you feel there’s hope. Especially if she’s logical despite the emotional side or she’s someone you can reason with. 

I’m very emotional but I’m also logical. I can think reasonably and 90% of the time I hold myself accountable for the shit I do. I wished he saw that if he really wanted things to work with me. 

But if things changed so bad that you just simply don’t have the drive or patience to work things through and it also affected how you feel about her then it’s hopeless. And you need to communicate that also. 

Hope my story was useful to you

My ex-husband, instead of dealing with is many problems, decided to cheat on me then manipulate me into being poly (this was before I knew he had cheated). I said we could try it. His girlfriend was a histrionic trainwreck who caused so much necessary drama in my life. Then when they broke up, he went on the hunt and I watched him throw thoughtful gifts and time into other women while I was just randomly sleeping with people but not getting attached. Then when I did get attached, suddenly it was wah wah wah you're not being fair...you're spending so much time with him blah blah, as if I didn't spend years being accepting of him when he did it. Then I realised I wasn't poly, I was just fucking sex-starved and lonely (ex-husband had sexual problems and blamed me, thus poly but surprise! the issue was him all along, who would have thought?). Then my new partner was so thoughtful, caring, loving, sexually compatible, funny, intelligent that I was like, sorry I want you all to myself and he was like me too. So now we're together and ex-husband is out of the picture. 

But trying poly meant I saw a LOT of fucking horrible relationships. People lying to other partners to not cause drama, so much drama, 50 year old men calling themselves liberated feminists preying on 20 year old women, manipulating people into that lifestyle, rules for thee but not for me entitlement, the list goes on and on.

Not ONE relationship was ever long-term or healthy. It's easy to not work on relationships when you know you have a main partner and can just break up and find someone else. 

They espouse the idea that all poly people have great communication and they simply fucking don't. They're just as childish, jealous, insecure as any other person but they pretend that they are special and better because they're doing something different.

Hell, even the book they all talk about reading for poly advice (More than Two) was written by a couple who have since had an explosive break up and are not together, which doesn't bode well. One of the authors was said to be abusive and manipulative which, to me, is on course for how poly relationships are. 

And I'm not saying that monogamous relationships can't be unhealthy, but when a group of people say their relationship dynamics are much healthier and better...don't believe them. All relationship dynamics are festering with predators, and polyamory is no different, but the thing is that they like to show themselves and feminist, queer, leftist, safe...and can be very much not this.",431,2025-11-11,09:56:59,0,0.986756801605225,1,"love",0.735935389995575,1

The boss at my old job would pinch our cheeks and call his female subordinates ""sweetheart,"" while treating the men more formally. Depending on how pretty you were, he could be more benevolent. It seemed affectionate, but frankly we were in a work environment and I don't like being treated like a little girl as if my value as a worker depended on what I have between my legs and how pretty I am.

I thought he would ask me, since I do speak English, but he assumed I didn’t and disappeared. 

In my current job, the boss prefers to be accompanied at conferences by the only single man, even though he is by far the most incompetent and the least talented at public speaking, frankly messy and almost chaotically disastrous.

My Mom was deeply insecure due to her own childhood (Grandma hated being a parent). Mom was very validation-seeking (with men and religious folk) and that meant tons of shame and fear-based parenting. If i didnt liked the same things Mom liked, she took it as a blow to her self esteem and became very degrading toward me. She gossiped about me (degrading me) well into adulthood for not seeking her approval on my life choices and for not being the clone bestie she always wanted. I moved far away during my teens. I went very private (stopped sharing my goals, purchases, and love life) and went low contact 8 years ago. She told everyone she ""didnt know why"" i was so cold an distant.

Realized in high school that I was smarter than my creationist science teacher. In my world religions course, I realized that religions were all basically the same (eg. Don't murder, marriage, etc.) and had probably just evolved through cultural selection.

Then I took a science degree while conservatives waged a war against science because they didn't like the idea of climate change.

Then I entered the workforce and realized what an unequal relationship employment is (even as a privileged white man).

As far as actual content of this, talk about the basics. Women are people, too. Even worse, they are also teenagers (at his age). They are capable of evil and will hurt you intentionally if they perceive a benefit to doing so. A girl who jerks you around or makes you compete with some other guy is not worth keeping around. Always wrap it, even if she's on birth control, because you need to control what you can control. Women can lie, too. Insulate yourself from accusations of impropriety. Your girlfriend cannot be your whole life, and its important for your own safety and security that you have a rich and fulfilling life without her.

My generation and before (GenX) have been taught that men are strong, stoic, internalize your feelings, and work on the problems from within.  We don't talk about feelings with other men, women, or anyone.

Now... experience and wisdom tell me that what was taught is total shit.  It's ok to talk about how things make you feel. It's ok to open up to people and go to therapy. It's not a sign of weakness.  It shows emotional maturity.  If anyone tells you otherwise, treats you as less than, makes you feel bad or insecure about opening up.... then those people aren't worth two sticks to rub together to make heat.

People talk about 'toxic masculinity' but that seems so one sided.  Women dont want us to talk about toxic masoginy, but were expected to listen to them gabbing their fucking mouths about that shit.

Pretty much true. I get matches at speed dating, then email suggesting a day / date and get nothing.

> Online dating is broken, that does not mean you are broken: Just because you do not get matches does not mean 100% you are chopped. 

Took me a while to realize this. I'm an average looking guy, nothing special. I do get matches, but it took talking to women (platonic friends) to understand their experience on the app. Turns out that a huge % of the time the reason your conversation fizzled out is: she gets too many messages, and turned notifications off on her phone and lost you in the shuffle. Meanwhile guys barely get any matches at all, so their hopes are up especially if conversation is flowing -- sucks when it dies.

Women are so vastly outnumbered by men that they're spoiled for choice, which makes the matching and messaging process hellish, but also makes the actual dating process hellish. If you don't wow them or they don't feel ""the spark"" on the first date, they won't bother meeting you a second time because they have a queue of double or triple digit ""likes"" in their inbox.

I, for one, take time to get to know someone and don't always feel that spark right away, so if I were dating that way I think I'd be missing a lot of opportunities, but that's just the math of it. It's a mess.

 I do wonder about the 4B thing. 

If people weren't dating, having sex with, marrying or bearing the children of any of the guys they're talking about *to start with*, is it actually a protest? I mean, if (as a political protest) I declare I'm not playing in the upcoming World Cup, and I don't play and wasn't going to in the first place, is it a protest or just self-praise for what I was doing in the first place? 

 And is it a blanket separatist-feminism thing like an Adrienne Rich kind of thing (in which case good luck and godspeed but it's none of my business, by definition)? 

Or is it more of an ""until we reach our societal goals"" Lysistrata kinda deal?  (Because, judging by the rhetoric over on the sub, they don't seem particularly willing or able to deliver on that implied bargain- any more than MGTOW's old ""marriage strike"" thing had teeth, because nobody was marrying those guys to start with.)

When we look to cinema and literature, examples of the best type of men are all over. The hero. And what makes them that way...

These heroes are pretty much all capable of immense violence, but they know **how to control it.** They use their capabilities only when necessary. And THAT is strength.

Wear a cologne that matches you + event + location.

Casual with friends

Your question was how much? From man to man, if I am within arms reach, that is when I should smell it. Not too strong, but not too light. I want to sample what your wearing but not take it home with me. 

I would say 1-2 sprays is enough. Layering is also important. Wearing a blazer? The cologne goes inside. Just adding a touch on top? Extend arm away from body and spray.

If the woman can respect that's what I want for my life, then I see no problem with her pursuing her own ambitions. I do not expect her to cook, make the house or whatever. She can have that fire and go out achieving whatever she wants. I'll enjoy sitting by the fireplace somewhere with a whisky in hand.

Take a simple thing like a meal. If I go to a nice restaurant, I want to enjoy a juicy steak without any baggage being attached to it. But some ambitious types will say things like ""Hey, that's 29573 calories. After this we'll need to go for a 6.3km run to burn it off to keep our health goals."" 

Or something like, ""Hey, why don't we join the protests for peace in the Middle East? We may not change much but every effort counts ya know? It's better than relaxing at home!!""

Sorry but I cannot get along with such types. I want to enjoy life and don't want every aspect of it to be tied to some goal, standard, achievement, limits, struggle, etc.

So while some traditional men may be put off by ambitious women because they prefer old-fashioned gender roles, there are also pragmatic ones like me who realise it's an unworkable dynamic.

This happened with my ex-fiancée/mother of my daughter and we were together a total of 12 years.  She has been diagnosed with Bipolar I and BPD, which factors into my reaction.  The first time she cheated, I pretty much caught her red handed.  We'd gone out with our own groups of friends that night and agreed to keep each other updated so we each knew when the other would be home.  I got home first and texted her to let her know that.  Then I told her I loved her, hoped she was having fun, and asked that she just send an update when she gets a chance.  An hour goes by, nothing.  She usually answered me pretty quickly, so I felt a bit weird about it.  Texted her again, asking if she was alright and that she please update me.  Another hour or so goes by, no answer.   At this point I'm legitimately worried that something happened to her.  I called her a couple of times, but she didn't answer.  By this point it was like 2 or 3am and I was feeling sick to my stomach.  I literally thought she'd gotten into a car accident or something - never crossed my mind that she was cheating.  Anyway, I  remembered her phone was on my plan, so I used Find My Phone to see where she was, then I got in my car and drove there.

Long story short, when I walked up to the house she was in, I saw through a big picture window in the front that she was sleeping on a mattress in the middle of the living room, in her underwear, with this obese, older man I'd always thought she was just friends with.  He was this eccentric dude, in his 50s, that lived on a tiny house boat and spent most of his time going to local music events.  Essentially a homeless guy.  This house was apparently his mom's house.

Started ringing the doorbell over and over until she sat up.  We locked eyes, I threw my hands up in a ""wtf are you doing?"" kind of motion, and waited for her to come to the door.  When she did, I said ""You've been cheating on me with *him*?""  Then I told her I hoped it was worth throwing away everything we'd built and went home.  I was done at that point - until she convinced me that this only happened out of impulse due to a manic episode she was having.  She cried, blamed her mental health struggles, and told me she needed me - that I was the only one who knew how to deal with her.  I genuinely believed her and I felt obligated to stick it out.  I'd already been through a lot of abusive situations with her, lashing out at me every time she gets frustrated - I guessed this was just another one of those things.  I'd known about her diagnosis before I even proposed.  I had chosen to stand by her and support her.  I even read books on how to be a better partner and the best ways to be supportive of a partner suffering from these specific mental health issues.

We started going to couples' counseling and I was starting to rebuild some trust.  Things were getting better.  Then out of the blue, I got a call at work from her.  She told me she'd been cheating on me again and she was worried that she was pregnant.  I felt my soul leave my body.  In that moment, I became a husk.  She'd been bringing some guy (different than the first) into our *house* while I was at work - while our daughter was napping in her room.  The only reason she confessed to me was because she'd told her mom first, and her mom said ""You tell him or I will"".  Turned out she wasn't pregnant.  I had zero self worth at this point.  I was devastated, but numb.  She went through her whole thing, crying, blaming her illness, etc., but all I could think about was our daughter.  I didn't have the energy or willpower to uproot everything and I wanted my daughter to have both of us around, so I just threw my hands up in defeat and said ""We'll talk about it in our counseling session"".

Our therapist really went after her for this.  Not in an unprofessional way, but she really held her accountable, encouraged her to explain herself, made sure she understood what this did to me and to our family, etc.  It was cathartic, but I was still basically a zombie at that point.  I was defeated.

Eventually time went on and we sort of just stopped talking about it.  I was pretty much on autopilot - working full time, paying the bills, and just focusing on our daughter.  At this point, she was a toddler and she was the one bright light in my life.  I still remember coming home from work after a long, shitty day.  She was sitting in the middle of the living room on the floor, playing with her toys.  As soon as I walked in, she looked at me for a second, then threw her toys down and sprinted over to hug me, screaming ""DADDY!!""  I almost broke down into tears.  It was the first thing I'd felt in a long time, and I'll never forget it as long as I live.  She kept me going.

She is faithful. She is loyal. She is an incredible communicator. She is emotionally intelligent.

She never gets triggered and projects on me. If she does happen to get triggered, she will say to me, “I’m triggered“. This gives me a chance to ask her why, and we can have a calm, mature conversation about it.

She is consistently emotionally available. She attunes to my needs. Needs are not threatening to her.

She is not threatened by other women. She has developed incredible self trust with herself. This allows her to trust me. I have friendships of the opposite sex, and she never has any issue with this.

Her self trust lets her know that if I should ever fail her trust, then her future self will handle it. She will be ok. She will leave me and move on. She will find someone she can trust. She will handle, face, and move the pain. All this lets her know that her present self can be present and trusting. She can trust the future to her future self.

She sees me. She knows my heart, she knows that I am faithful and loyal to her, and she does not let her triggers tell her otherwise.

We both love and accept each other, and are able to be close and intimate and emotionally available.

1. Key Neurotransmitters and Hormones


​Dopamine (The ""Feel-Good"" Neurotransmitter):


​This is the star of the show, heavily involved in the brain's reward system.
​When you see, hear from, or think about the girl, dopamine levels surge, creating intense feelings of euphoria, pleasure, and motivation—similar to a natural ""high.""
​This surge reinforces the desire to seek out and spend time with that person, making the experience highly addictive.


​Norepinephrine (Adrenaline's Cousin):


​Also known as noradrenaline, this is responsible for the physical signs of attraction, like a racing heart, sweaty palms, flushed cheeks, and the feeling of ""butterflies"" in your stomach.
​It contributes to the energy and excitement of new love.


​Serotonin (The Mood Regulator):


​Interestingly, serotonin levels often drop in the early stages of intense love.
​This lower level of serotonin is associated with obsessive thinking about the person, similar to what is seen in Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder (OCD), which can make the girl feel all-consuming in your thoughts.


​Oxytocin (The ""Bonding"" or ""Love Hormone""):


​While more prominent in the later stages of attachment, oxytocin is released during physical intimacy like hugging, kissing, and other skin-to-skin contact.
​It promotes feelings of trust, closeness, security, and emotional bonding.


​Vasopressin (The ""Attachment"" Hormone):


​This hormone is linked to behaviors that promote long-term, monogamous relationships and pair-bonding, generating a desire to protect one's partner.


​2. Brain Regions Involved


​Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI) studies have shown increased activity in several key brain regions when a person in love looks at a picture of their partner:


​Ventral Tegmental Area (VTA): 

A central part of the brain's reward system, rich in dopamine neurons. It is highly active and releases dopamine into other pleasure centers.


​Caudate Nucleus & Nucleus Accumbens: 

These are part of the reward and motivation centers. They ""light up"" in response to the anticipation and experience of being with the person.


​3. Deactivated Brain Areas


​Equally important are the areas that show reduced activity in early love:


​Prefrontal Cortex:

 The region associated with rational thought, critical judgment, and decision-making. Its reduced activity is sometimes cited as the reason why people ""put their partner on a pedestal"" and are less likely to notice or judge their flaws (i.e., wearing ""rose-colored glasses"").


​Amygdala:

 A key structure for processing emotions, particularly fear and negative judgment. Its lower activity may be why you feel a sense of emotional comfort and security with the person, and are more open to the vulnerability of falling in love.",22,2025-09-29,05:50:14,0,0.995258986949921,1,"joy",0.99686074256897,1

Start using finasteride and minoxidil the second you notice your hair thinning or your hairline receding.

Likewise, men at places associated with other personal hobbies - guitar stores, car meets, game shops, gun ranges, etc.- are likely open to a chat, especially about their hobby.


Also, do not think that you have to limit yourself to just typical 'social' things. Go ahead and say hello to any single-looking man you like the look of, really wherever. There is no social stigma against doing so, unlike in the reverse case. Note that you do not have to walk up to some dude all 'hey, gimme your number' or anything else so forward. Just do enough to let him know it is acceptable for him to speak to you and see how it goes - there is a decent chance he will make the move if the two of you happen to 'hit it off', so to speak.",2,2025-11-09,14:36:50,0,0.998469173908234,1,"anger",0.822856485843658,0

I do think friends are a great place to find potential partners if you catch feelings, but you have a very healthy approach of not minding if they didn't also, because you value their friendship so much.

It's true that for women it can be a bit much to just go up to them and hit on them more or less. But I do think it's fine to approach them to strike up a conversation for potential friendship or whatever, you just have to find the right flow.

For example, in college, a guy on the bus said hi to me and asked me if I was in his Ethics class, and I was, so we talked a bit about the class. Eventually he said he would be at the school cafe later, and invited me to come join him for coffee. I thought it was a maybe date, but it turned out he was gay and just making friends! We became good friends.

Another guy from the dorm next to me commented on the weather at the bus stop, and I was open to chatting so we chatted a bit about that, and he invited me to come watch stuff at his house. It wasn't a love connection but it was fun.

So try to go out with friends, to places that there will be over other people your age that might be interested in making new connections. I think you just have to learn how to feel out when people are signaling they are open to more anything. If you glance at a woman and give a polite smile, does she smile back? If so, after a minute, maybe you can make casual conversation, and if she is engaged and making conversation back (and not just to be polite), you keep it going. At the end, if she seems receptive, you can invite her for a safe, chill activity, like ""Me and some friends are doing xyz later, if you might be interested in coming by! Feel free to bring friends too!""

It can take some time to learn to read signals like that. I think you're still not quite there if you've told multiple female friends that you were interested and they weren't feeling it. That's okay, it takes a long time to learn to read signals. Just keep trying, and don't be afraid of a warm-open like one commenter said. Go to as many friend hang outs as you can, and you'll meet more people.

Number one is beauty, both external and internal. 

I care about her career, but, not for the reason you are thinking. A woman's career doesn't add anything to a woman's attractiveness, but, it definitely can completely remove her from consideration for a relationship. According to divorce statistics the most promiscuous fields for women are nurses/doctors and teachers. Similarly, any field where the woman is or has to be a ""boss bitch"" to succeed, such as a lawyer/CEO or Corporate Executive/Business Owner is also an immediate disqualifier for me (I hate masculine women for relationships). And for obvious reasons, any sort of sex work (prostitute/escort/OF/etc) or social media whore/influencer is also a hard pass.

She must get on board with my plan and be able to follow my lead.

She must not have children nor want any children of her own while being an amazing role model for my daughter (I don't expect her to pay for anything my daughter needs and she will not replace my daughter's mother).

She must be a classy lady in public and a complete slut for me in the bedroom.

I could perhaps have gorged on take-out daily or sustained myself with baked beans on toast, however I grew up in a family obsessed with good food. So naturally I cooked for myself and have always had a well appointed kitchen. I would think it rather manly that a man can look after himself than merely needing a woman to mother him. My grandfather who was one of the manliest men to man ever was a spectacular cook.

- Being well groomed. I can't exactly go to a meeting with a client dressed in wrinkly miss-matched clothing can I? Also, the fact that I have always smelt good often made women gravitate towards me.

What I think of statements like this one is that you're telling me how you perceive what you're about to say if you were on the receiving end of this message. The distance you're trying to create is telling me that you aren't emotionally willing to accept responsibility for the thing you realize is harmful. 

>  men don’t understand or know how to do romance. 

I agree and I think women don't understand or know how to do romance either. You are the master of your own desires. I am the master of mine. The best way anyone could romance you or romance me is to have a conversation about it where we both get to say what we desire from one another. 

> What is it with dead conversations?

Monkey see, monkey do. When you were young, you learned through watching and mimicry. In school, you were taught to be polite and task oriented. Part of what you see in dating is humans doing their very best to mimic one another as that's the default way to connect to one another. Imitation is the sincerest form of flattery. Part of what you see in dating is the emotions of wanting from another person and in particular how fear and safeness are being calculated. And part of this is not having a script. It is much harder to be on the same page when you don't know what you are aiming to do for the other person. 

> Cryptic messages.

I generally think of this as falling into one of two buckets. 1) he's heard that women like a little mystery or 2) he genuinely believes his message to be logical but you don't have the necessary background information to make the connections he's communicating about.

>  I want to dress up for a man.

Collaborate with your gender about this one because you're just as likely to meet a woman who abhors this message as you are to find someone like yourself who wants to meet his visual desires.

>  I want him to seduce me.

Much easier to answer this call when there is an accepted script for doing so. Remember opening doors for a woman? Remember the backlash to opening doors for a woman? When I have to guess whether or not you'll like an action then I'm left feeling like I'm being given a test with no knowledge of how to pass it. And then the feeling of unfairness about being tested without being given the knowledge of how to showcase willingness to learn?

>  I want a cat and mouse game.

There are men out there who do that and if I had to say, it mostly ends with your heart broken and negative perceptions about men including many who aren't playing games with you. 

-----------

> What do you men actually want?

You can't answer this generally and shoehorn it into any man individually. Generally men want love. Generally men want sex. Generally men want empathy and compassion. Any given man will want a different set of things. You won't just say ""feed him and give him sex"" and find that you've fulfilled all the desires of every man in the world. 

> Do you understand what romance entails?

Just about as much as you do. You know what you want and you don't know what I want. Same for me. The hurdle to getting what you want is gated behind your willingness to acknowledge it openly and the willingness of the other person to give it to you. 

> Are all men just little boys inside?

I'm inclined to answer yes and to add that all women are just little girls inside too. We're all born to a collection of experiences that mold how we interact with the world. We are conditioned to act in ways that culture ascribes as appropriate for us. We add on layers of experience from interactions with the opposite sex, and form perceptions about the group based on those individual experiences. So yeah, I'm inclined to believe we are all little children learning about the world one interaction at a time and using those experiences to color our perceptions of one another.

 > Do they suck at self awareness?

This is your experience based off your model of how the world works. I promise you two things. 1) you have someone in the world who sees it the way you do. 2) You have many people in the world who see it differently than you do. I fall in camp 2, and my reasons for doing so are based in my experiences. Just because I don't act the way you think I ought to doesn't mean I'm not self aware and I say that for myself too. I believe in the depths of my being that you didn't come to this ""terrible"" conclusion from a desire to belittle me or hate on me. But those are the perceptions that first strike my mind based off my experiences with those who share the same gender as you. 

> Sometimes I’m in disbelief that the greatest poems and songs are written by men. 

This is the evidence that leans on what you have discarded from your experience. I wonder how many times you've thought to ask for this gift. I wonder how many men would give to you out of a desire for your affection? I wonder how perplexing it is to have your experience so far mismatched from the appreciation of those writers and singers?

>I'd like to respond with my own grandstand

If you accept that you do NOT really understand me as well as you think you do, then you might come to potential relationships with a desire to be both the teacher and the student as I do. . If you are more willing to openly acknowledge your desires by using your words to communicate them, then you might be lucky enough to hear my desires in return. As I mentioned above, we are mirrors and we mimic. Are you as invested in writing the lovely poems and songs for me that you wish to hear from me? How do you give men the keys to your heart? How do you treat their experiences? How do you listen for their desires? How do you meet their inner child?

I think the worst fucking book iv read was the fourth wing? By yarros.... It was the worst written sex scenes I've ever listened/read. I had to stop and skip forward and then it happened again in a couple chapters. I dropped  the book after that. The writing was so abysmal regarding vocabulary, tension, and description.... I think a highschooler who's never had sex could write a better sex scene. I honestly started this book for the dragons and interesting plots/ideas, what a fucking disappointment. 

I've found books that don't do smut as the selling point actually get me way more aroused. I think the 2nd book in the first blade trilogy has a couple scenes where you can appreciate the emotional tension, attraction, dialog and build up but then it kinda lightly touches on the act it's self with just simple descriptions of the thrusting, hand movements and described skin, and sounds. It fades to black or goes to another person's perspective for comedy. It was very well done because it paints an emotional and tactile picture but allows you just enough wiggle room to imagine things. They didn't need to go into super detail about size, girth, moisture, or any of that bizarre shit in women's smut. It's just very straightforward and emotionally fulfilling.

You have to value letting things go. Moments can have value without permanence. Fulfillment doesn’t always come from attachment. Sometimes it’s from presence, connection, or just shared humanity, even if it’s a brief moment of time. You can appreciate a beautiful sunset without having to own the sky, right?

I know you are specifically here to ask men about things but I want to say and emphasize as a woman that your trauma and the damage from what was done to you is just as valid as anyone else's. 

There are resources for victims of sexual assaults and other crimes. You should look into what your local community has for victims. There are often state programs as well. They can help in a lot of ways and the resources are for ANYONE who has survived an assault. When I was getting help from one there were just as many men getting help as women, especially for the legal side of things. 

I'm so sorry this happened to you. I'm so glad to see in the comments you are getting help through therapy. Therapy helped me SO MUCH. It took me a couple tries to find a good match but someone who specializes in trauma/PTSD is always my recommendation. I did EMDR and it made a huge difference very quickly but it was VERY draining to do. 

I never was able to do anything regarding pressing charges for the sexual assault either. I hadn't realized it was what it was until all the evidence was gone and time had passed. On that bit I just want to say it's okay that you didn't do anything. Oftentimes trying to procure charges against them results in additional trauma though I can understand wanting to pursue them for so many reasons. What matters now is that YOU ARE SAFE. Stay away from the person that did this to you. Have a plan for if you bump into them somehow. Have safe people who know your history that you can go to if needed. Your safety and well being is your #1 priority and that's how it should be. In those moments, you did what you had to do to get safe and recover. 

I am glad you are safe now. May peace and healing come your way.

How do I deal with this without becoming extremely jealous or envious?",153,0,226,"MamaBear4485","nl1a2f8","Ok honey let’s breathe here. I’m sorry that you’re spending TG alone, holidays are always difficult in split custody situations. Try to find comfort in knowing that your children are at least happy, and that you’re instrumental in their happiness.

Regarding your finances, from other responses you’ve posted here it sounds like you’re determined to do the right thing by your children. That’s a huge thing, and someday you’ll be able to explain that to them.

So right now, you are an employed person. You get up each day, go to work (remotely!) and earn your way through the day to the best of your abilities. That shows a willingness to do your best no matter what.

You’re an active and participatory parent as much as possible. Your wheelchair is a silent testament to your abilities and your inabilities. That’s enough of an explanation to anyone.

You’re determined to pay as ordered, which means you’re left with less than you would otherwise have. That means you’ve made adjustments to your own lifestyle for ethical reasons. You’ve chosen to put your kids first.

You’re determined to avoid ugly court battles for the sake of your children. As someone who spent a decade being dragged around the system by an actual psychopath who was determined to torture his child and me for the sheer pleasure he derived from it, that makes you a good person in this regard.

People who speak casually of child support and court as though it’s easy and clear cut have very likely never had to deal with it. If the other party decides to be difficult the system can be played out for a very long time.

Consider this - your willingness to pay for child support without argument partly allows the new families to enjoy a better standard of living than they would if you not only didn’t pay, but also chose to drag them through deeply stressful and incredibly expensive litigation.

I know it’s not easy to do the right thing, and in the early stages it’s not always easy to see the full benefits of choking that path. But I promise you that in a decade from now you will have no regrets if you choose to continue to handle the situations by choosing to continue to do the right thing by your children.

What matters is not petty back and forth between adults. What matters is that everyone concerned focuses on the innocent children caught up in a situation they have no choice but to live in. 

People tend to forget that this is not about $$, minutes, rights or who forgot to bring the sports equipment. While those things matter, what matters most is this is the only childhood these kids will have, and it’s up to the adults to put them first and give them the best childhood possible.

My only advice is to get a parenting app such as parentingtime.com and at least use it to track expenses, calendars and documents. There’s also an awesome journal on there as well. Even if you don’t use it for litigation, you could give your children access when they’re older and let the facts speak for you.",2,2025-10-23,22:08:54,0,0.998857975006104,1,"joy",0.991901695728302,1

Physical attraction can fade with familiarity.  Emotional bonds though, can strengthen with alignment and reinforcement.  I'm 21 years in and 18 years married with a great woman.

I am a man. I know that and I am comfortable with that. I am confident enough in my own masculinity to know that I could dress up in the silliest and frilliest dress and that wouldn't diminish my manliness. It's not something I have an interest in doing because that doesn't appeal to me on a personal level, but it isn't something I think would inherently compromise my conception of my gender.

Additionally, my sexuality really doesn't define my day to day life. I'm a straight man who was assigned male at birth, or cis/het, or however else one might one to classify that. Being a straight man means that I'm sexually, romantically, and physically attracted to women and that's pretty much it, and being highly monogamous means I'm really only attracted to **one** woman- the one that I love and care about.

Now, for me personally, I see being concerned about the opinions of other men regarding my manliness and sexuality as very unmanly. I simply do not care what they think. I will hug my cats and tell them that I love them and I'll brush my horses and give them kisses on the nose and I'll buy candles that smell nice and sweaters that are soft, and I'm not super worried about how people perceive any of that because I know that I am obviously a man. I'm also not afraid that any of that compromises my sexuality at all- I have a lovely girlfriend and we have frequent and awesome sex. Doing things that are coded feminine doesn't change my biology and it definitely doesn't make me attracted to men. 

On the spectrum of sexuality and human behavior, liking a rom-com is **very** far away from fucking a dude. I really don't see a man doing something with a woman he's romantically connected with that they both enjoy as being homosexual at all- in fact, I see it as very much **not** homosexual.

A man should be kind, honest, and upfront in his dealings with others. He should take advantage of those who are vulnerable and he should strive to improve both himself and his community. He should take care of his body as much as he's able and he should aim to be a good friend, a good neighbor, and a good person.

A straight man should probably (and will usually) have sex with women and not men.

They touch you. Like in an innocent Oops way or if theyre bold in an obvious way. Especially my arms ime.

They linger around you. Like hover in your area, or make noises to get your attention, basically giving you the chance to talk to them. 

They low key give you opportunities to check them out. Like my neighbor is a recently divorced fit milf and my girl actually pointed it out that the neighbor always dresses ""slutty"" when im outside. That she changed into more revealing clothes when I got home. 

Oh that circles back to lingering. Milf was always watering her plants right around when I got home from work. Always made sure to say hi and make small talk.

Board Gaming is a really underrated hobby i my opinion and I find the world is split into two camps when it comes to board games: The people who think Monopoly is the only board game adults play and the people who know the difference between American Style board games and European board games. 

With board gaming there's literally hundreds of games out there that fit just about any tastes. And there's games that can be played by groups, one-on-one or even cooperatively. And solo board games are a huge market and they make a great alternative to video games. And they're naturally social activities so you also get to meet people and hang out or have a nice chill session with your friends or family. My wife and I really got into the game called Star Wars: Outer Rim. I don't usually go in for games based on movies but this one is so much fun. And it has rules for solo play that are pretty fun. 

Rock Climbing and Bouldering is another hobby I have that I feel is a pretty nice alternative to hitting the gym. I'm a middle-aged man with a typical dadbod and every time I go tot the gym I literally dread it. I find it boring, tedious, tiring and pointless. I can go to the gym for 2 hours every other day and I *maybe* lose a few pounds. But my teenage son and I started climbing and while it's pretty intense on my old bones (seriously, I'm usually the oldest guy there) it's much more interesting and exciting. There's a big mental difference between running on an elliptical for 20 minutes and scaling a 4-story V-8 Grade wall or finally managing a V-6 problem on a bouldering wall.",3,2025-10-21,12:39:34,0,0.998903393745422,29,"joy",0.995579183101654,1

There is no amount of points you can save up on the human success card to qualify for one free love or companionship with purchase of a large soft drink. There is no such thing as being owed either.

What you are entitled to is the prerogative to live your life in a way that, provided it does not harm others, brings you joy and fulfillment. And when you are a person who is able to experience joy and fulfillment *without* having another person be the battery that powers it, that's when you will be attractive to others.

No prospective partner wants to be responsible for your happiness. They want you to be happy and they want to share that happiness with you. At which point it becomes a choice, not a responsibility. I choose to do everything in my power to make my wife happy, not because she needs it but because she deserves it. If I felt like I was burdened with her emotions instead of reveling in them, I would be miserable. That's codependency. That's unhealthy.

So your first step here is to get it out of your mind that there is a threshold you need to cross to earn love. That's bullshit. Get yourself to a state where you experience joy. And make sure you don't require a partner to make that happen. That's when you'll be attractive.

Women’s need for men to make the first move and to ‘lead’ is explained by evolutionary reasons - without writing an essay, essentially females assess male ‘fitness’ just like those wild birds in nature documentaries where the male bird dances and female assesses his performance. 

Men making the first move is part of the performance and assessment of ‘fitness’.

I’d certainly like women to make the first move too but I have learned to accept it just doesn’t work like that and energy is wasted wishing otherwise.

The answer is to get good at approaching and that’s all there is to it. The thing is approaching DOESNT have to be perfect so it’s not worth getting in your head

I cheated once when I was 19 and never cheated after that. I never want to put anyone through the pain I've put my ex through so it's very unlikely that I'll cheat. I've been with people I've lost interest in and still didn't cheat. I hate the stigma of ""always cheater"" it's so stupid.

I did date The person I cheated with. It ended up being a 4-year relationship. We almost got engaged. But thankfully I realized that she wasn't the right person for me. She's still one of my closest friends to this day though.

Edit: I just want to add that this question should only apply to people that have the availability to cheat. Like people that are in relationships that have no one else that are interested in them cannot cheat. Therefore, their voice on this and loyalty to their partner isn't tested nor should it be valid.

I have the ability to cheat because a few of my homegirl's mutuals are interested in me however (and I know this is going to sound funny) I like to mess with only one person at a time.

As in no, you’re not even allowed to defend yourself or your children with anything that could be considered violence.

The laws are stupid! In some areas if a woman hurts herself attacking you, you go to jail. Not only that your reputation and thus livelihood gets ruined. It gets out that you’re a wife beater, even justified, even in self defense and you lose your job, your friends and even your family is likely to turn their backs on you.

Hurting women or children puts you at the lowest of the low, a true coward, weakling, scum. Western culture has gotten so gynocentric, so misandrist that if a woman attacks you, unless you got it on camera that it’s not, “you [must’ve] had it coming,” and sometimes even then you’ll get “what did he do to her before the cameras were rolling?” like women can’t just be vile psychos too. So defending yourself from a woman is basically dodging accountability, refusing to accept what you deserve. 

Just because you are capable of defending yourself physically doesn’t change it from the same dynamic you’re talking about in your experience. Yeah she can’t beat me up but that doesn’t mean fighting back is fruitful. She may not take me down, but she’ll cry to the authorities, to the public, and what I’ll get in return is way more damaging than a black eye. 

There are no support groups for men in DV situations, basically no battered men’s homes or shelters. Because that would be sexist I guess?

In traditional dating, people often met through intermediaries—friends, family, or coworkers—or while engaging in shared interests, like attending church, visiting the library, or playing golf. These connections provided both parties with a chance to gain a deeper understanding of each other. A friend or family member acting as a matchmaker could vouch for the other person, creating a sense of familiarity and security.

In contrast, online dating reduces everything to a two-dimensional image and a few words hastily written in a bio. Many profiles on dating apps seem to reflect exhaustion and discouragement, as if the person behind them is on the verge of giving up—worn down by experiences of being ghosted, lied to, disappointed, stood up, disrespected, frightened, or even disgusted.

You said you don't care that he's 5'5, which is fine, and good on you that you don't care about his height.  Most white guys are going to be taller than that, I've only known 2 guys that were 5'5-5'6, and they both dated girls as tall as them, maybe slightly taller.  Hispanic guys are generally around that height, so maybe the guy is hispanic?

That being said...you may not care about his height, but the question you should really be asking yourself is ""How will I feel if we go out and I'm wearing, or wanting to wear, heels?"" That coule inches you have over him is now going to be amplified more. Think of how Tom Cruise looked next to Nicole Kidman when she was in heels...or Tom Holland next to Zendaya in heels. You may ne ok with it, but will he have a complex over it?  Will you be able to deal with your friends comments? If you honestly won't be bothered by it, and can still see yourself dating him if it works out, then go for it and ask him out. If you have any doubt, it will only get worse as your friends/family make comments.

In general people don’t know how to react. So honestly, figure out what you need and ask for it clearly. 

See a professional if you can’t figure it out. 



In case a personal anecdote helps…

Story 1:
I also struggle with suicidal ideation. Although i have only considered it once. But without getting into graphic descriptions. Specific environments never fail to bring up vivid images to mind. 

My psychologist and psychiatrist are both of the opinion that i am not “at high risk”. Mainly as i a) recognise the triggers and b) reach out to them outside of my regular appointments when i notice an uptick in ideation. 

I only ever talked to non-healthcare people about my suicidal ideations after i lost my little brother. 

Story 2:
I lost my little brother to suicide. He also had drug problems. Through talking to his psychologist and psychiatrist and reading his diary and notes we found out a few things:
- he lied about how suicidal he felt and saw it a saving grace if he couldn’t quit the drugs
- he took long to ask for help for the addictions because he was ashamed, but ultimately relieved when we agreed to stay with him every day and night until he was checked-in to rehab
- he lost hope and felt like the day to day was too painful 
- his psychologist, psychiatrist and addiction doctor were not in contact and did not have the full picture.

it can be. there can be other reasons though.


I said this once to a woman I had a serious class difference with. as in she's wealthy (comes from wealth) and I'm not. and I just didn't want to deal with that to be honest. it was always going to be an uphill battle. if you know you know.


and I didn't say it, but I thought it about another woman who had a lot of desirable qualities... but tended to think rather highly of herself. she had multiple degrees from top schools, which she earned because she was very intelligent of course... but her career and her education and her success were such a huge part of her personality that I found it off-putting. I'm also highly educated, I have a good career, I'm fairly successful. those qualities didn't bother me, I was attracted to that in her. but the dynamic felt uncomfortable, it felt like on some level I was always in a job interview.


my conclusion with the second woman was that she's only going to be happy with someone who meets all of her criteria in a very specific way. and I might actually meet them to be honest... but I don't want to date someone whose criteria I have to meet, or have to worry about meeting. I find it exhausting. also to be completely honest, if I made a similar list of criteria, she wouldn't meet it in some ways. but the difference is that I don't have a set of rigid criteria that I ask women to meet.

The story gets picked up by feminist bloggers, and then by anti-feminist bloggers who use it as an example of what is wrong with the feminists, until eventually three or four large subcultures are debating it simultaneously. It snowballs until it gets its own its own Wikipedia entry and then a competing Conservapedia entry explaining exactly what was wrong with the Wikipedia entry and which incidentally is longer than Conservapedia's article on God meaning that my failed attempt to ask this one woman out is literally a bigger deal than the all-powerful creator of the Universe. It is welcomed into the realm of Official Scandals by being granted its own -gate suffix, and a Google search for it turns up 13900 results, including the biography of the girl I asked, the twitter hashtag relating to my rejection, and the one year retrospective. Hundreds of rape threats ensue. Richard Dawkins takes a break from being one of the world's leading public intellectuals to get involved. And if Conservapedia is to be believed (sic), it apparently leads directly to the decline of atheism and the explosive growth of global Christianity.""

Story time- I have a vivid memory from an age I can’t remember but fairly early memory nonetheless. Farting loudly to elicit laughter from friends had just become a thing and I did it to make my dad laugh. He didn’t find it funny and told me, “that’s not funny”. I also have another separate memory from my grandpa commenting that smelling a fart is literally inhaling poop particles which medically speaking is kinda close to the truth.

Having spent my adult life in very male dominated environments farting loudly and even publicly is still funny. But I don’t do it because of the aforementioned experiences. 

I see videos online depicting farting or discussing bowel movements as a barometer of how close you are to your partner and it’s just not for me. If I was dating girl and she made a show of farting or belching, no go. But I also don’t expect her to hold in normal body functions to a point of discomfort. 

My point of view: farting or belching loudly on purpose is gross. But passing gas or belching is not unladylike given normal body functions. If your partner is unbothered, live your life.

To start, I think there’s 100% a double standard, as many have pointed out. Yes, most women require clitoral stimulation to orgasm, but that doesn’t mean they require it *from toys*. At that point, you’re getting into the realm of personal preference or what form of stimuli works best. “I *need* clitoral simulation, but I *prefer* that stimulation to be in the form of vibration.” There’s a difference there. Additionally, the comments made by several people about the difference in approach to these issues are 100% true. If a guy is having difficulty staying erect or finishing, the immediate assumption is porn addiction, death grip, etc, not erectile dysfunction due to health issues, anxiety, or a variety of other normal and common factors. At the same time, if a woman is having trouble reaching orgasm, the response is a combination of support, things to try (often toy or lube suggestions), and ways their partner should be doing more.

With that said, your question was how I navigate it. Simply put, I don’t. At the end of the day, we’re all different, and we all have different needs and wants and preferences. Likewise, what works one day may not work the next because of stress, anxiety, adhd, or a variety of other real world factors. Sometimes things just feel/hit different. My stance has always been that your partners pleasure should come first. If both people in the relationship have that mindset, everyone wins. Ultimately, I don’t care what it takes to please my partner, I just want to make them feel good. If that’s with parts of my body, good. If that’s with them stimulating themself, good. If that’s using toys, good. I’m still a part of it, I’m still there experiencing it with them, I’m still happy to be making them feel as good as I can. 

I think, more than anything, people on both sides just need to get out of their head. Stop looking for negatives. Stop trying to identify defects.

I haven't lost at this little game yet, even though there's some serious competition. It's probably because I've never spoken to a quadriplegic.   
  
Until I was 7, my parents were millionaires and I had a more than happy life with a large family. My father had an accident, suffered a traumatic brain injury, and spent two years in the hospital relearning how to speak and count. He lost many useful brain functions, like logic. My mother had cancer and didn't get treatment while my father was in the hospital; she died two years later.   
  
My father sold everything and was scammed by numerous prostitutes for many years. He beat my sister and didn't understand what he was doing wrong (traumatic brain). The justice system did nothing except place my sister in foster care and leave us alone despite our complaints. No more family fortune and even hundreds of thousands in debt.

I'll skip the details, but seven years ago I was living with my dad while I was studying. He had a lot of people over, and they were shooting heroin like crazy. I remember one time I came home from school, my dad was on the floor, and his ""girlfriend"" was having sex with a guy in the kitchen. It broke the stove. I had to fight with prostitutes, drug dealers, and burglars within a few months. The burglars were there because my dad had given the keys to a prostitute who, of course, made a duplicate before returning them. Luckily for me, I never ran into anyone with guns, just poor junkies with nothing going for them. When I moved out three years ago, he left the water running in the apartment he'd just vacated, which destroyed a business on the floor below. He must be a million in debt. 

Today I have a great job that I love, and I live wonderfully with my cat. I've finally rediscovered what peace and joy are.

The youngest is closer to my personality and we love to playfully bicker but also talk about school subjects as we are both bit of nerds.

We used to annoy our mom by laughing at some stupid inside jokes and choking on our food at the dinner table.


The second youngest is a more sensitive soul, but in a good way. He is highly empathetic, philosophical, considerate and really good with people. He is also really smart in things he gets interested in and my adhd buddy. He tends to be my biggest supporter at times, especially when it came to my studies and now career in ICT. He is genuine. He openly admires some of my traits and skills but only when he truly means it, and he also wants to learn them from me. That works really well for us because I like to teach people. I also admire him back and have learnt things from him. His social skills, wisdom and empathy are on another level.

Take responsibility for your part in all of this. Do YOU want children? “Letting him sleep with you” is this someone you actually want to be with? Are you a participant in HIS life or are you trying to build a life WITH him? You need to decide what YOU want and start advocating for it. Stop lying down and saying “Well, if you want…”. You are supposed to be a partner not a housekeeper with a warm body dedicated to his wants alone.

It also could have been avoided if you did a little more soul searching and asked yourself what YOU wanted instead of just saying “Well I thought he wanted…” There are two people in this relationship. Start acting like you are one of them.

Stop being a pushover. You are not his property, you are his partner. Take equal space for yourself.

Work on yourself. Think LONG and HARD in that hotel room about what you want out of the relationship, and then advocate for it. Do not let him run the entire relationship like your vote doesn’t matter. 

Seek a therapist, there are a lot of good telehealth options out there, work through your trauma and grow up a little bit. He didn’t create this issue alone. You both played your parts and you both need to take responsibility.

If so, how?",267,0,124,"rjhancock","np8hxg4","> Sure women get the custody 90 percent of the time, but that's because mothers and usually much more involved with their kids than fathers.

There are fathers I know who were far more involved but got stuck with a man-hating woman judge who, even with photo and video proof that the MOTHER was dating and fucking a REGISTERED child sex offender, still saw the father as the least safest person for the child to be with.

> And that only happens if you are making more than she does.

Incorrect. You can make LESS than she does and still be forced to pay. Ability to pay is only PART of the equation. It's about how much the court decides is required to support the child then they determine how much you are required to pay from that.

In addition to that, more often than not, when the father does get custody, the mother is not required to pay.

It's only been recently (think the last decade or so) that involved fathers have been given ANY kind of possible respect regarding custody. The courts, my default, assume the mother is the better caregiver and should have the child/ren. Fathers MUST fight for it, women are GIVEN it. And when fathers look at the costs, time, and impact it will have on the child/ren compared to the most likely outcome of losing regardless, it's better for the CHILD/REN to not fight UNLESS they request to be with the father.

It's not that father's don't fight for their children, it's that most are fighting with their kids best interests at heart while the women are generally fighting for a bigger pay check.

Grannie was a stereotypical wealthy WASP.  She was broke, but she still remembered being very wealthy, and continually her granddaughter's head with stories of wealth and privilege that the grandmother had enjoyed all her life, but which were completely foreign to the granddaughter.

Like, parents had me diving off 10 meter boards while camping out the back of an '82 Dodge passenger van when I was like 6, most of my earliest memories are in water.  Lakes, streams, town pools, friends pools, the Jersey shore pretty frequently.  By high school I was 6' tall and on the swim team with a state-level freestyle and back stroke. Once an adult, I became an advanced open-water SCUBA diver.   I've got about 120 dives under my belt now and a couple of night wreck dives.

Of course the woman I marry is born/raised NYC and will not go into a 3' deep pool.

We have kids, she puts them in swimming lessons, but we don't use them that often.  We are in Mexico on vacay, the youngest is in an inflatable ring around his waste, AND he's got inflatable arm bands.  The kid is a floating blob, he cannot move his arms, or his adorable little head. Frustrated, I tell the wife that they are never going to learn to swim, until we give them the freedom to start to move.  I tell her I'm going to take his arm bands off, but leave him in the ring.  She objects, I make executive decision and pull off the arm bands.  She is not happy, but not mad.  She found my aggrevation a little funny, and I wasn't being a dick about it, but she definitely reiterated that she was NOT happy with this.  I tell her not to worry, they'll be fine, we are a group of six adults, nothing's going to happen.  

For the next two hours, they were fine.  Then the little one runs off to the bathroom.  He gets out, he drops his ring, runs to the bathroom, runs back, puts the ring on, jumps in with giant laugh.  Except this last time he forgot to put the ring back on.  He hadn't held his breath, he didn't know how to swim.   Four of us adults were sunbathing, the other two were in the pool but because of its shape and size, they could not see my son. 

I remember hearing him laugh (it always makes me giggle); about 30 seconds later my wife asks if I can put lotion on her back, ""of course"" I say.  She takes a few seconds to re-tie her bikini top before sitting up at the same time as me, to apply lotion.

Think you have the right idea, in that overall the split should be 50/50 but depending on the category, it may be skewed toward one person over another.

For me, I make 3x my partner but also work 1.5x her hours. So I take the majority of the financial burden, while she manages the majority of our personal responsibilities.

So financially, I pay 3/4 of our expenses.  What that looks like is I cover the mortgage/rent, insurance (my company also has better insurance), most major purchases (car, appliances, etc.) + my personal expenses.  She covers our living expenses (groceries, home maintainence \[including handyman/landscapers, etc\]) + her personal expenses.  We both have emergency funds, mine is bookmarked for any major expenses / if one of us loses our job), hers is for more simple unexpected expenses (car/home maintenance & repairs, simple medical, etc). We both also have independent investment accounts (since we both have an interest and existing accounts). O I also cover any group meals/entertainment (but more for society than anything else). When we have kids, this will likely stay the same, though I would pick up school expenses (daycare, tuition, etc) and she would pick up clothing, hobbies / interests, social events etc.

Responsibilities-wise, as I mentioned, she picks up the groceries, but we both split cooking food since we both enjoy cooking.  In our house, the person who cooks doesn't clean the kitchen, so whoever cooks that night dictates that.  Otherwise, she cleans/maintains/manages the house (including laundry) mostly, and I do the handyman work (building furniture, simple home/car maintainence / repairs).  She also manages our families, our collective social calendar (though we both also have our own independent social lives as well).  Obviously, there is flexibility for all the above but in general, that's the breakdown.

One thing I would also like to highlight is decision-making.  So obviously, while I cover all our major expenses, all major decisions are made collectively.  If there is a major purchase I want to make that she doesn't agree with, that comes out of my personal expenses, and vice versa.  That being said, decisions on the work front are a bit more skewed toward me since the majority of our collective salary comes from me.  For instance, we both had a company event a few months back on the same night, so she attended mine and skipped hers.  On the home front, she typically gets decisions skewed in her favor.  For instance, I didn't really like the landscaper, but since she would be the one managing them, she made that decision.

In terms of kids, since I often work late, we plan that I will spend time with them in the morning before I leave, and she will manage their days and evenings.  Weekends, we plan on obviously spending them together, but will allocate relatively alternating weekends for independent social events.  We both plan on being actively involved in their development and plan on following relatively traditional roles there.  Think my brother put it best, in that she will protect and nurture them, and I will prepare them for the world.",3,2025-10-14,21:32:30,0,0.998533129692078,24,"joy",0.829428136348724,1

Bring him peace? Did you ever offer sex or are you only seeking affection that doesn't lead to anything? Are you doing enough housework?"" It would - rightfully - be called victim blaming, but this is somehow acceptable to put on men.

In fact, the last couple of times I'd opened up about prior abuse, one women kept leaving comments (after asking a leading question so she could) to tell me how it wasn't a big deal and women have it worse so I should shut up.

Then that's a sign they only care about what you do for them and not how you make them feel. BUT most people will still speak about the incident and how they're feeling even after the gift, and that's when you should realize that they do care about how you make them feel.

More for the benefit of what they're getting from you and then interacting.

I think its a selfish, disrespectful thing to do.  My ex-fiancee cheated on me multiple times with multiple people trying to ""win her over"" - all of whom knew very well she was engaged to be married AND a mother of our child.  Every single one of them walked away after, too.  I could go on and on about that relationship but I won't.

Basically, people who do that (in my opinion) are extremely selfish.  They only care about their own gratification and don't care who they destroy to get what they want.  I feel very strongly about it and have even stopped being friends with people I'd known for years when I found out they were trying to sleep with married women.  I get it if they don't respect the woman's husband - often they never even see or hear much about him - but it's also disrespectful to the woman herself.  They're willing to destroy her marriage/family just to get in there and have their fun. 

I'm glad in your case, it gave you the strength to leave an unhappy marriage, but based on the fact that this guy disappeared on you, it tells me he's exactly like the people I described.  He wanted to sleep with you, but didn't want to commit to a relationship with you.  He lied about loving you.  When you filed for divorce, shit got real for him and he ran.

I (61M) remember being about 14 listening to the Beatles, reading a lot and observing my friends parents and my own, and thinking that I wanted a woman who wanted to have kids, who was very intelligent herself, had her own interests and career (whatever it might be), was kind to other people, was sensible and didn’t smoke. Not in that order. I just thought about the kind of woman I wanted as a life partner. I was never interested in casual sex or one night stands even before I had a girlfriend and that has not changed since I had my first girlfriend. 

I realized that to get a woman like I dreamed of I had to become the kind of man that a woman would want to have as her husband for a long term relationship and have kids with, so I had to be careful in the choices I make and how I act around other people. I had to work on myself first. 

I also REALLY wanted to have a girlfriend/wife that I found very attractive and who would love me for who I am, be enthusiastic and playful in the bedroom and would this would hopefully last our lifetimes through all the physical changes and challenges that life brings. 

Hanging out with my friends and talking to girls at that age made me afraid that I had unrealistic goals, I’d get cheated on and ignored/disrespected despite my best efforts. I expected to be disappointed and have to settle for less than my dreams. But I was going to give it my best shot.

I lost my dad 5 months before my daughter was born. He never got to meet my daughter. It destroyed me when he died. The grief crippled me for many months. And now, it’s still there, but it’s less intense and permanent but it’s still very accessible mentally.

Everyone thinks they have a good idea what every emotions are, happy, sad, etc. there may have been a time for example when they felt that specific emotion. In my experience however, people sometimes don’t know true grief. 

It comes for you whether you are “prepared” or not. Grief is the longing for something that you’ve lost and will never get back. Many people have either never experienced it or turn away from it emotionally or with vices.

The best thing I ever heard on the topic was from Jay Shetty I believe. It goes something like this: when you lose someone you don’t really get over it. It’s a stone you have to carry. There is no choice in the matter, as this stone is symbolic to your relationship with the person, however fragmented, if the love was true. And with time, that stone might still be heavy… but you become stronger… and you’re able to carry it as you move forward.

Girls are overloaded with male attention since puberty, especially now with dating apps. The most unattractive girl you know has more likes/matches than the top attractive guy. It is what it is, girls just truly don’t understand this aspect of male dating. 

Girls do like being approached if they find you attractive, status (in work or life), and/or well known (ex. You think she doesn’t want to be approached by Drake or Robert Pattinson? Or even a Zohran Mamdani?)

Dating apps - pictures pictures pictures. It’s a surface level attraction game with the apps. High quality shots of you taken by someone else, no pixelated bullshit or selfies. 1 group photo so girls don’t think you’re a psycho. No shirtless pics unless you’re jacked. No fish or deer you killed, that’s just creepy to society.

learn from the rejections, you’ll eventually find patterns of attraction and approach that works for you. Learn strategies like templatize openers for dating apps, hanging out with female friends at bars/clubs/restaurants and approaching other girls (girls like guys with other girls, idk what it is biology, etc.). Level up your haircut, physique, clothing (amazing how many guys fuck this up - wear proper sizes, shirts should match shoulders, pants should match waist, leg to ankle length, wear slimmer fits to compliment physique). TRAVEL - for all the shit passport bros get, one things for sure, girls just are attracted to whatever adventure you’re on and want to be part of it + you get a free tour guide out of it. Makes for fun stories.

One of the things that helped me get over this in college was a group of friends would compete every week to collect as many phone numbers/instagrams from girls, try to convert them to dates, convert to smashes, etc. boy do you develop a thick skin from this. Different guys have different speeds of dating/personal growth, it’s just time and effort, eventually you find that someone.

the process of grief is awful, you beat yourself up, get sad, get angry, get emotional, but don't think you should repress any of these emotions, they're all natural and they're part of the process. 

Definitely look for support groups or therapy if you're struggling.

I would get very emotional every day for the year he was very sick with cancer, and found that after he died I became very numb for about 2-3 months, then it came like a tsunami of emotion for me. Just embrace it and try to not deflect it with booze or other harmful things that could make it worse in the long run for yourself.

I'm the only boy with 4 sisters, a step mum and mum, and my mother told me ""you're the man of the family now!""

I'm not particularly close to my sister and I don't know that she was wrong but it was just super weird and uncomfortable, and again this was stuff that had happened like years in the past.  I have a hard time imagining her brother even cared at that point.  It just seemed super petty on her part.

Everything you do as a hobby, have fun and or do becomes much harder to do. Sleep will evade you for the first while (only had 3 hours last night) and you begin to develop an ability to run perfectly normal with that much plus maybe a coffee or two. Also you become a lot less intimate with your partner (for obvious reasons) and your main focus is your baby in all aspects of your life.

However, it is worth it on a scale you can't imagine.

True we may not go out anymore, go crazy on hobbies or anything else.

Whenever you are down or sad, getting a cuddle or hug from them makes it all go away. You begin to plan for all aspects of their lives and you begin to forget about going out for a drink or jumping on with the lads to play some games, they become your biggest priority or interest in your life.

I've gone through similar phases in the past - sometimes weeks - and they absolutely start taking a toll on you. You're no less of a man for speaking up about something that troubles you, or for seeking help.

Insomnia can have many causes - some psychological, like stress, anxiety or depression, others physical, including a variety of undiagnosed illnesses. 

If this has been an ongoing issue, it's worth looking at with a doctor. If you haven't already, keep track of your sleep cycles (with something like a smartwatch), so you can show your data to your doctor. Be honest about the toll it's taking on you, and be open to different approaches. Sometimes, medication can help; in other cases, it's about fixing nutrition issues (iron deficits can cause insomnia, for example). 

It's okay to need help, and it takes strength to admit that and to seek that help.
