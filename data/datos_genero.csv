1. It must have a fireplace. (It does, it was damaged in the Northridge earthquake but it is fixable.)

2. It must be in a neighborhood that goes hard for holidays, particularly Halloween. Because I intended to be *that house.* The one with the full-size candy bars that's happy to see you and loves all your costumes and *oh my goodness look at the cute Spider-Man, T-rex, 80s boombox, and Chinese takeout carton!* ""oh, look, honey, it's Carmen Sandiego, Travis Kelce, a tomato, and a whole Valhalla of Vikings!"" *::dumps giant handfuls of candy in pillowcases::*

We moved in on October 22, 2023. I sent a text to the neighborhood text thread I had recently been added to, asking about how much candy I should stock. I was assured that no matter how much I bought, it wouldn't be enough.

Reader, what I heard was *✨️showtime.✨️*

My door cracked open at 6 for the littles, and by 7, it was pandemonium until 8:30 and then it dropped off. We had about three boxes and a big bag of the Wonka fun sizes left. 

I bought about the same amount last year, and we were cleared out by 9. The neighborhood also had about double the traffic we did the year prior. My neighbor joked that word must have gotten around that the gingerbread-looking house on 20th had full-size candy bars, so our neighborhood became the must-stop destination. I shot back, ""Mission Accomplished.""

This year, year three, things are a little different. We were both laid off right after we bought the house, thanks to the tech industry/tariff bloodbath and we are unlikely to survive it as homeowners -- we're out of runway and options and we are likely to be in foreclosure before the end of the year. But I still have a little money left, not a lot, but enough to stock twice what I had last year, and I am asking my neighbors to do the same. We're gonna be *that neighborhood,* and I'm gonna be *that house,* dammit. *THAT HOUSE.*",7,2025-10-01,02:38:00,1

* First up I like to talk to them for a long time before I actually meet them. I am a texter so we need to go on well through text if it's gonna work.

I prefer coffee dates for a first date because:

* They're in public crowded places
* It leaved it open to end it quickly if things go wrong (you don't have to sit through a whole meal or worse a three course meal) but it also leaves it open for you to plan another activity and/or moving on to a restaurant if all goes well. Usually I have something planned like I looked up a movie in a nearby cinema or found an event happening on that day so that I don't show up completely empty handed
* You don't waste a lot of money on a bad date (I like to pay for myself, but I also don't feel too bad if they insist on paying and I don't want to see them again)

For the early stages of going on dates:

* Under no circumstances are they allowed to know where  I live until I would actually want them to show up in my home uninvited.
* Only go on the early dates while on my period

If I wasn't pretty confident about my Judo skills, embarrassed to let anyone know I'm going on a date, and had people who cared I would also let someone know where I'm going and with whom, and have check-ins throughout the day/night.

I didn't hear about it before I met my fiancé, but if he regrets his life decisions and I find myself single again I am definitely demanding an STD test and (relevant for the country I live in) proof of not being married and living with the people they say they do before I'm in a relationship and get intimate with them (I don't have intimacy with people I'm not in a relationship with, not judging just my personal preference due to being demi). I am getting myself and my fiancé tested too. It's just good hygiene to do when the tests are as cheap and available as they are today.

I’m very loyal and monogamous. I can have guy friends but nothing romantic. It depends on who I’m with and if he’s seeing more than one woman. Some men are capable of making you feel like the only woman in his life—meaning decent attention, like you’re not missing anything. And somehow make you feel secure even in a Polyamory situation, and some the opposite. 

I don’t wanna see him with someone else. I don’t wanna see him dump me or hurt me for another woman. Been there and it killed me. I can’t do it. Seeing him show up for another woman. Give love and affection. Show care. Tell them he misses them or is happy to see them or happy to spend time with them. He can have another date with someone else but I don’t wanna have my heartbroken like that in front of my face. 


For me the biggest trigger is the other women themselves. If she rubs it in my face or boasts about seeing him or sabotages his time with me. That triggers all the devils living at the bottom pit of my Hades and they come erupting like bats out of hell.

The biggest problem in a situation like this is in case it’s another woman taking advantage of you. Meaning it becomes a competition, or he is incapable of hiding his affection which ultimately shows if it’s more towards one person than another. 

It’s expected that even in a normal relationship with two people someone will love more than the other person. And in a Polyamory situation in my case it was obvious how much he cared about one woman more than me. 

It hurt me immensely. She’s known him for a decade and knows how he ticks. I don’t. Everything is new to me. Showing up during a time when me and another friend had plans with him. Deliberately sabotaging his time consistently to intimidate you. Posts stories about her love life with him to rub it in your face. Shit like this I can’t tolerate. 

For me I’m very private and discrete. I don’t share anything about the person I’m with. And if there’s another person I would never rub it in their faces. Never did it once.

"260",49211,"AskWomen","Sexy_Madness","1oc4osw","What is your relationship with your mother like?",147,FALSE,33,"Darkness_Nox","nkkle58","Complicated.

She doesn't respect any boundaries that anyone us trying to set, she's also a big time hypocrite and I just don't respect that about her. She is also prone to exaggerating, lying and playing the victim, she also always discredits your pain because of X Y Z that happened to her in her life and obviously she had it worse. And since she retired few years ago, the phrase she uses a lot is ""I've worked my lot in life, I'm done with everything"" as if retiring from a job automatically strips her of the social responsibility of being a decent human and family member and it's supposed to excuse her shitty behaviour. And one of me and my sister's favourites, which she has told me she heard her say behind our backs ""I bought this home. And the other one too, it's my money, I should be able to do whatever I want"" in regards to us having rules in our homes that she doesn't ever respect. Nobody asked her to ""buy"" us homes. And it's not ""her money"", it's both her and my dad. He is the one with the much higher salary. And she forced us to be listed as the home owners in the property's documents upon buying. 

Recently she stayed over at mine as I was hosting my teenage niece and she was looking after her as I was away on vacation. I had kindly reminded her that there is to be no smoking in my home any longer as I'm pregnant and the effects of second hand smoke still affect my child and as non-smokers, me and my husband don't tolerate this in our home. She scoffed and said she never planned to. I also reminded her to not move around my things qnd rearrange my house. My niece not only reported that she was smoking inside and not even opening the windows, but she also took liberty to rearrange my house and she ruined a lot of mugs and other things that I valued by relentlessly scrubbing them with a metal scrubber. When I confronted her she denied and said my niece lied and that I'm imagining things and I'm being ruthless towards her and I need to stop. She had also ""cleaned my house because it was dirty"" and that was the justification for the rearrangement. I informed her before my trip that I stayed up all night and deep cleaned. I didn't sleep and nearly missed my flight. She ended up very upset because I was enforcing boundaries when I called her from abroad that she wanted to leave immediately with my niece and just abandon my pets without care and didn't even feel remorse when I told her if I can't find anyone to watch after them I'd have to change my tickets and fly back. I was in Paris and about to get engaged and she was okay with ruining that for me because she just hates it when things are not done her way and she has to respect other people. 

She reluctantly took our dog and I was lucky to find a sitter for our cats, but of course I was blamed for not making better plans and having her take care ""once again"". Oh you see I did have plans arranged. They fell through because 1 - there were going to be 2 people in my house at all times and askibg someone else to come take care of the pets was unreasonable. And 2 - I was going to spare her the chore of looking after our dog by taking him to my husband's family in another city. Very unfortunately our car broke down enough for us to not consider it safe to drive such a long way and good thing we didn't, because the car repair garage said we could have literally caught on fire mid-drive. Yet my own mother wasn't too concerned about me nor the fact I'm carrying a child. It's just inconvenience for her and it's my fault.

So yes, it's complicated because I recently feel genuine hate for her and wish she would be better or ideally, work on herself and her traumas and stop ruining our lives. Alas, I'm not considering not involving her in my child's life at all, that needs to be earned, she hasn't and I don't think she can.",10,2025-10-21,08:59:45,1

To answer your question it would really have to depend on his life circumstances relative to mine.  I'm an old woman but I'm not very progessive in my career so a lot of people in my industry make more than me.  I also happen to have a mortgage so my cash availability is not a lot ... plus I have a very expensive hobby so I pretty much divert everything I earn to it and am therefore not cash rich.  I cannot afford fancy dinners at michelin places or travel abroad but I'm relatively ok.

Most of my peers would be able to afford trips abroad and do go abroad.  Some paid off their mortgages so they are very comfortable.  I have a friend who makes what I do or less but he's way richer than me beause he has a lot of other investments and ventures that earn him other income.  Even though he complains he's only renting a studio apartment, it's a studio because he has to live near the beach whereas my place is not near a beach so more affordable!

If I'm just going out with someone I probably don't care but as long as we can have a comfortable and decent meal and time, it's all that matters.  However I do travel a lot for my hobby and if it's someone long term, he may not be able to keep up if he cannot afford to travel or he's not keen on spending his money on it.

And as I mentioned, I'm old.  This means I'm used to certain levels of comforts so if I ever do travel, I'm not hacking it in a hostel with 24/7 music or sharing bathrooms with 10 other people; I would pay to have my own room but on the other hand I don't indulge in pedicures or manicures or facials.  I think I'd be more concerned with someone who could afford to keep up with my lifestyle than how much he makes.  I have another friend who doesn't work at all but he just has money since his apartment was bought over by a developer and he gained some cash in that transaction.

If someone comes from a very different background than yours it becomes a little difficult to relate to each other. It’s not a deal breaker but it can be uncomfortable. 

Example—sharing what you do and how you live can intimate the person who earns less. The person who earns less might feel incapable of providing a similar lifestyle to the person who earns mor and could break their confidence. They think they need to match the lifestyle. 

For me personally I value the way they ethically spend more than how much. So it’s more of a turn off for me when a guy tries to compensate by showing off their wealth or they use money unethically (stealing, dishonesty, gambling, etc) more than not being able to match salaries. 

It’s more attractive to be hardworking and passionate. I’ve got a few examples in my family where amazing men married into some of my distant cousins with very comfortable lifestyles and they ended up being very happy. The guy is so loving and supportive and hardworking. They ended up supporting each other and growing. It’s so inspiring to watch honestly. 

And I have other examples in my family where a very rich guy married a girl who’s well off but not like him. And his family never really got around to accepting her or liking her. It caused a lot of tension but they made it work.

I was 900 miles away from everyone I knew and loved. I had no support system or friends outside of him. Every friend I did try to make, he sabotaged the relationship.

He slowly isolated me from the world. I couldn't even talk on the phone to my family without him present. He wouldn't let me drive or work. He made me totally dependent on him, and then blamed me and held that over my head, which just furthered the whole cycle.

I had a friend in high school who started to go Sheen that misogynistic path. He complained about women ""lying"" with makeup. So i did his make up. He had that chronic pink skin thing (can't spell it) and cystic acne. I did a natural look on him to cover the redness and acne and contoured his face. He loved how he looked and it just clicked for him! He actually felt really bummed that he ""couldn't"" wear make up because he felt so much more confident with just an even skin tone and less obvious acne. He loved the contour that made him feel more masculine. He noticed that he immediately sat up straighter and smiled more when he saw this version of him. That's what make up can do for a lot of people

Makeup is also just another way to express yourself--no different from hair or clothing. Hair cuts aren't natural. Clothing is natural. But we all engage in those no problem. Sometimes I enjoy loud make up and clothes. Sometimes I prefer to blend in. Sometimes I prioritize comfort. I do what makes me feel good in that moment, and if you don't like it, don't date me.

I also know that our bodies are constantly aging and changing and physical beauty and youth are merely a season of life. Even someone with the perfect diet and exercise routine with all the money for cosmetic procedures will eventually be a little old person (if they're lucky).

So if there will always be something about myself that I need to perfect and I will never be able to make everyone like me and it will all fade eventually no matter what I do, is it really worth it to me to obsess over my imperfections and live in a constant state of pain and shame? 

Maybe it really actually doesn't matter and I can just cut to the chase to make peace with my ""flaws"". Maybe I can find the beauty in other people as they are and I can actively choose to apply that appreciation to myself.

I definitely still struggle a lot, but keeping these things in mind help me disrupt negative self talk about my body and appreciate the beauty in the world and myself, which feels especially important these days.",2,2025-10-18,10:27:59,1

If it was new or recentish relationships, then I think I could do it. Politically, I'm down. Logistically... who has the time (in my age group, 40s)??

Speaking from where I am, 17 years in to a relationship - there's no way I'd be keen to have another person, not as a third (all three of us in a relationship together), and I'm even less keen on either of us having separate relationships with others.

As boring as it sounds, this is mostly around logistics, fairness, and the sort of ""family"" bond that happens over time and changes things. 

Sorting out things like family obligations, what do we do when a parent needs to move in or we need to travel and support them? How do we support each other through the seriously hard stuff, like if someone gets seriously ill, or becomes disabled, or needs serious support in some other way? It's easy to say, ""we'll just make it work"", but I can't see a way that it doesn't end up competitive or unfair, having lovely new relationship energy on one side, and family-bonded difficult intimacy on the other.  And at the most basic level, splitting your time would be tough, especially for those working long hours, running businesses and/or caring for kids or others.

I think that imbalance - a long relationship between two people, then newer ones with others - seems like it would create a hierarchy on the one hand (""old"" partner having supremacy, just logistically even if not on purpose), or the ""old"" partner feeling like they need to compete for being exciting, fun, cool, sexy etc.",66,2025-11-11,08:59:26,2

I fell in love with the little things he did for me that showed me how much he cared. I loved the high regard he had for me. The loving way he used to stare at me. The high importance he had for me.

I get to hear him boast about other women and point out how amazing they are at a time when he was pushing me away and telling me he doesn’t give a shit about me.

His children have spoken up different times here and there but were very negatively received because people worship this writer. His wife has always been tight lipped. His wife has become active on social media since Covid and she is also an amazing narrator. 3-4 days ago she wrote a status about how her husband threw her outside of the house in the middle of the night in freezing temperature. She kept knocking the door but he didn’t open. She realized she would freeze and die soon, so she ran to the closest store. It was closed but she rang the bell. She was wearing a shirt, pants, and flip flops. The store owner lived upstairs, they opened the door and took her in. They asked if she wanted to call the police. She said no I have to go home. They looked at her weird and gave her a jacket. She went home later as if nothing happened. Their child who was a toddler then (it was the 70s), was crying and crying. They never talked about it as if nothing happens but she’s grateful things like this didn’t happen in her children’s lives. 

This is a very prominent writer and filmmaker she was talking about. The whole nation has a parasocial relationship with him even after so many years of his death. They are not ready to mix art with artists. They say his wife shouldn’t have put this on the social media when he cannot defend himself.

I’m the person who someone broke up with because I’m emotional, (not aggressive), but he felt I wasn’t good for him—too stressful, a handful, and insecure. 

Maybe it helps to give you my perspective (from the opposite side). 

I know I’m emotional. I know he’s busy and I can see how my insecurities made him feel uncomfortable. Like he’s walking on eggshells and he has to be careful. If I see him with another woman I get triggered and I sulk or I get in a bad mood. It makes him feel like he can’t be himself around me. He loves his space and freedom. He felt me being emotional and wanting him to speak to me more, connect with me more—rubbed him the wrong way. 

I never defended how emotional I was or insecure. I asked for what I needed—more validation, but timing and his limited time and someone else he’s more comfortable with all got in the way of me and him possibly finding a compromise to make things work. 

When I felt him change and distance himself I knew I was losing him and it terrified me. And this part is important—it triggered me more (especially for an anxious attachment person). 

My biggest fear was losing what I had with him after waiting a lifetime to meet someone like that who I was able to love that way. But the more he distanced himself, the more I was insecure and triggered. 

In his defense he was so overwhelmed. He didn’t know how to tell me it’s over. He made excuses. He kept silent. He gave me what I wanted to hear on a superficial level while depriving me access to himself and our connection. 

At the same time I see him connecting with other women and that was emotionally BRUTAL for me. 

The more he withdrew, the more I felt triggered and the more I felt triggered the bad sides of me showed and confirmed his judgment and resolution to distance himself. 

It was a horrible cycle. And the more advantage someone else he cared about was having seeing me pushed aside. 

Moral of the story: DONT DO IT THIS WAY. 

Break ups are painful. Someone is going to get hurt no matter what. It IS personal. But not being honest and fading or ghosting or withdrawing is going to make it ten times more painful 💔 

When I knew it was over with him, all I really wanted was comfort, knowing it was ending on good terms. I couldn’t get that at the time because I was just getting more and more negative and it bought the worst sides in me. And I can see his disappointment. 

It’s your right to change your feelings and end things, but you also owe it to someone you initially liked that may not be currently on the same wavelength as you to know how you feel exactly. They gave you their time, and possibly connected to you on an intimate level. It’s not cool to just shut someone out when you decide to walk away. 

Be honest and transparent. 
“I saw potential in us being together but I don’t feel happy at the moment” 

If you like many aspects of her except for the emotional side, then try to communicate that if you feel there’s hope. Especially if she’s logical despite the emotional side or she’s someone you can reason with. 

I’m very emotional but I’m also logical. I can think reasonably and 90% of the time I hold myself accountable for the shit I do. I wished he saw that if he really wanted things to work with me. 

But if things changed so bad that you just simply don’t have the drive or patience to work things through and it also affected how you feel about her then it’s hopeless. And you need to communicate that also. 

Hope my story was useful to you

My ex-husband, instead of dealing with is many problems, decided to cheat on me then manipulate me into being poly (this was before I knew he had cheated). I said we could try it. His girlfriend was a histrionic trainwreck who caused so much necessary drama in my life. Then when they broke up, he went on the hunt and I watched him throw thoughtful gifts and time into other women while I was just randomly sleeping with people but not getting attached. Then when I did get attached, suddenly it was wah wah wah you're not being fair...you're spending so much time with him blah blah, as if I didn't spend years being accepting of him when he did it. Then I realised I wasn't poly, I was just fucking sex-starved and lonely (ex-husband had sexual problems and blamed me, thus poly but surprise! the issue was him all along, who would have thought?). Then my new partner was so thoughtful, caring, loving, sexually compatible, funny, intelligent that I was like, sorry I want you all to myself and he was like me too. So now we're together and ex-husband is out of the picture. 

But trying poly meant I saw a LOT of fucking horrible relationships. People lying to other partners to not cause drama, so much drama, 50 year old men calling themselves liberated feminists preying on 20 year old women, manipulating people into that lifestyle, rules for thee but not for me entitlement, the list goes on and on.

Not ONE relationship was ever long-term or healthy. It's easy to not work on relationships when you know you have a main partner and can just break up and find someone else. 

They espouse the idea that all poly people have great communication and they simply fucking don't. They're just as childish, jealous, insecure as any other person but they pretend that they are special and better because they're doing something different.

Hell, even the book they all talk about reading for poly advice (More than Two) was written by a couple who have since had an explosive break up and are not together, which doesn't bode well. One of the authors was said to be abusive and manipulative which, to me, is on course for how poly relationships are. 

And I'm not saying that monogamous relationships can't be unhealthy, but when a group of people say their relationship dynamics are much healthier and better...don't believe them. All relationship dynamics are festering with predators, and polyamory is no different, but the thing is that they like to show themselves and feminist, queer, leftist, safe...and can be very much not this.",431,2025-11-11,09:56:59,1

The boss at my old job would pinch our cheeks and call his female subordinates ""sweetheart,"" while treating the men more formally. Depending on how pretty you were, he could be more benevolent. It seemed affectionate, but frankly we were in a work environment and I don't like being treated like a little girl as if my value as a worker depended on what I have between my legs and how pretty I am. That was pretty condescending, too.

One afternoon (quite late), one of the big bosses came in with a foreigner (an investor?) unexpectedly, without warning, when only one colleague and I were left at work, doing the same type of work. The boss asked my colleague if he could explain to the investor in English what he was doing, and my colleague tried, but the boss cut him off immediately because he realized that his English was terrible. I thought he would ask me, since I do speak English, but he assumed I didn’t and disappeared. 

In my current job, the boss prefers to be accompanied at conferences by the only single man, even though he is by far the most incompetent and the least talented at public speaking, frankly messy and almost chaotically disastrous.

I had a chronic illness from age 8 (yay genetics). School and home were hell. I cooked, cleaned, did laundry as the oldest daughter for a family of 9 while my 5 brothers had 0 chores. My Mom was deeply insecure due to her own childhood (Grandma hated being a parent). Mom was very validation-seeking (with men and religious folk) and that meant tons of shame and fear-based parenting. If i didnt liked the same things Mom liked, she took it as a blow to her self esteem and became very degrading toward me. She gossiped about me (degrading me) well into adulthood for not seeking her approval on my life choices and for not being the clone bestie she always wanted. I moved far away during my teens. I went very private (stopped sharing my goals, purchases, and love life) and went low contact 8 years ago. She told everyone she ""didnt know why"" i was so cold an distant. In her mind, she was entitled to do and say a lot of things. I digress.


I started therapy 8 years ago. Read a lot of therapist books on boundaries, compatibility, reciprocity, self love, and conflict resolution. For now i understand that its primarily differences in values mixed with some emotional immaturity. She reaches out a lot but with the same old behaviors. Distance is more peaceful than tolerance. ",26,2025-11-11,09:03:45,2

Summoning up the strength and grip to get that thing open *without* obviously straining can be a real test.  You can't let them see the fear and desperation in your eyes!  You have to be strong for the ones you love and project an aura of quiet competence.

Even worse is the fight against the temptation to take the easy way out.  To announce my weakness by smacking the edge of the lid on the counter a few times.  Or even, heavens above... *reaching for a grip pad!* 

To demonstrate such a lack of shame before those I hold dear, and in full view of my ancestors, would truly be the end of me as I am.  I would be forever marked and become he who *was*, but no longer *is*.  A wretched thing with no honor, deserving of no name.


And so I summon up the will, and I grip until I feel muscles straining to their limit and tendons ripping free of their anchor... and the jar opens.  Thank the spirits!  Thus far, the jars have opened.

I dread the possible, perhaps inevitable future in which I meet my match and the jar lid does not yield.  In which my grip fails, my knees buckle, and I sink to the floor in a sobbing, half-mad, quivering mass that is of no use to anyone.  I dread the day in which those who matter to me are left deprived of the contents of their jars; the vital sustenance they need to carry on.

What helps is catching it *before* it hits that breaking point. Try keeping track of when it happens so you notice patterns. When you feel it rising, walk away, take a few deep breaths, or do something physical to burn it off, lift, run, hit a bag, whatever. It sounds simple, but it really helps.

>The four B’s are: **no dating, sex or marriage with men and no giving birth.**


 I do wonder about the 4B thing. 

If people weren't dating, having sex with, marrying or bearing the children of any of the guys they're talking about *to start with*, is it actually a protest? I mean, if (as a political protest) I declare I'm not playing in the upcoming World Cup, and I don't play and wasn't going to in the first place, is it a protest or just self-praise for what I was doing in the first place? 

 And is it a blanket separatist-feminism thing like an Adrienne Rich kind of thing (in which case good luck and godspeed but it's none of my business, by definition)? 

Or is it more of an ""until we reach our societal goals"" Lysistrata kinda deal?  (Because, judging by the rhetoric over on the sub, they don't seem particularly willing or able to deliver on that implied bargain- any more than MGTOW's old ""marriage strike"" thing had teeth, because nobody was marrying those guys to start with.)

I think the worst fucking book iv read was the fourth wing? By yarros.... It was the worst written sex scenes I've ever listened/read. I had to stop and skip forward and then it happened again in a couple chapters. I dropped  the book after that. The writing was so abysmal regarding vocabulary, tension, and description.... I think a highschooler who's never had sex could write a better sex scene. I honestly started this book for the dragons and interesting plots/ideas, what a fucking disappointment. 

I've found books that don't do smut as the selling point actually get me way more aroused. I think the 2nd book in the first blade trilogy has a couple scenes where you can appreciate the emotional tension, attraction, dialog and build up but then it kinda lightly touches on the act it's self with just simple descriptions of the thrusting, hand movements and described skin, and sounds. It fades to black or goes to another person's perspective for comedy. It was very well done because it paints an emotional and tactile picture but allows you just enough wiggle room to imagine things. They didn't need to go into super detail about size, girth, moisture, or any of that bizarre shit in women's smut. It's just very straightforward and emotionally fulfilling.

My generation and before (GenX) have been taught that men are strong, stoic, internalize your feelings, and work on the problems from within.  We don't talk about feelings with other men, women, or anyone.

Now... experience and wisdom tell me that what was taught is total shit.  It's ok to talk about how things make you feel. It's ok to open up to people and go to therapy. It's not a sign of weakness.  It shows emotional maturity.  If anyone tells you otherwise, treats you as less than, makes you feel bad or insecure about opening up.... then those people aren't worth two sticks to rub together to make heat.

People talk about 'toxic masculinity' but that seems so one sided.  Women dont want us to talk about toxic masoginy, but were expected to listen to them gabbing their fucking mouths about that shit.

I don't have any real need to rush especially with having young kids and dealing with my ex and co-parenting. My dog died after I found out about the infidelity and even though my ex was supposed to be responsible since she imprinted more on the dog, she gave up and the dog slowly died of heartache. Even though I tried to be a good owner that him out look after him especially since he then developed diabetes and I had to give him the dose.

As a woman I've definitely felt a lack of chemistry with people before, and there rarely is a specific cause. Not sleeping together wouldn't have caused it, but a lack of clear ""sexual"" interest could. I think like most women, I have always liked feeling desired. This can be a joke, a passionate kiss, that special look that happens in your partner's eyes where it's clear they really want you, or just an honest ""I'm sooo into you right now."" or a well timed and placed hand on the hip.

I know there is a fine line between being respectful and showing you want someone. But if you can learn to navigate that, you'll help the chances of you having chemistry with your dates. It doesn't replace chemistry, and sometimes if there is no spark, there is no help for it, but it helps to nurture any spark that is there to let your date know in these subtle ways that you are very attracted to them.",8,2025-11-12,21:38:54,3

Lots of women don't go for it, or life different body types. You have an above average dick. If your partner judges you based on dick size alone, you're in a shallow relationship.

Most of them were over in Asia doing that ""teach English abroad"" thing that was popular in the early 2000s.  My best friend from high school taught in Korea and married a Vietnamese lady he met online last year and brought her back here.

For those guys I guess I can see it as more or less acceptable, as they at least were over there and were able to meet these ladies and know their culture and whatnot.  But most of the other guys are usually on the creepier side of things and usually tended to be the sorts of guys who just wanted a domestic servant, or a mommy they could fuck.  A lot of the other sorts were also weebs.  I've also heard, second-hand, more than a couple horror stories of guys who married a lady from a foreign country and then that lady used him to get her family over here before divorcing him (from people who knew the ""victims"" in the situation personally, so its not completely hearsay).

And let me tell you straight out - I work with a lot of immigrants and ""crazy"" and ""toxic"" are most definitely NOT  western-only traits.  They're can be just as toxic and crazy, just in more indecipherable ways because you don't know their culture or if what they're doing is even supposed to be crazy to begin with.  That's not some racist statement, either - my little brother is Korean but some of those old Hmong ladies I work with put middle school gossipers and backstabbers to shame.  It's like a Dragon Lady cage match sometimes.

I know it gets discouraging - I've been there, believe me.  I will say that, as a 47 year old, I did notice a big and unexpected uptick in interest once I hit my early to mid thirties for some reason.   But of course then I was also in a financial situation that didn't allow me to really do anything about it.  I'm also not judging here, either - I had an e-pen pal who was a Malaysian chick living in London when I was in my early 20's and I'd have married her in a fucking heartbeat if I'd have had the chance back then.",3,2025-11-17,00:23:16,1

Lasting friendship needs work. If the one he has only wants to meet at bars, then you meet them at bars. He needs to actively try to hold together friendships for them to last. According to my experience though, the great thing about male friendships is that you might not talk for several years, after which it only takes one to reach out to get the ball rolling again.

Absolutely game changer and improved my life in many ways. 

Took some adjustment at first and when you go up in dose it takes a few days to adapt to the new dose. 

It should help most people lose weight in general, but if you combine it with a strict diet and workout routine on top of it, thats how you will maximize your results using the drug as a tool rather than expecting it to do all the heavy lifting on its own.

For me the biggest assist it gave me was that I was no longer driven by my cravings and toned down those voices in my glutenous head that it was so much easier to have discipline and make consistent smart food choices. Also just trained me to stop over eating cause I would feel like crap if I went way overboard. It was nice to be able to decide what to eat thoughtfully rather than just feeding the beast that wants a cheeseburger in my head. 

Also, surprisingly it really helped change my relationship with alcohol and helped curb that habit as well. 

Any weight loss regime is going to involve losing some desirable stuff like a bit of muscle mass on top of it. Some people will complain they lost too much good weight, and I think that is a real issue for some with these type of drugs, but that can be minimized and skewed in your favor with a smart diet (lots of protein) and training to help retain the lean muscle mass you have. I believe the people who experienced such just expected the drug to do all the work and effectively just starved themselves to reach an arbitrary goal weight... of course you are going to wither away if you dont fuel your body sufficiently. 

My diet was basically, breakfast: something like Yogurt, oatmeal, fruit, cottage cheese (vs my bacon egg and cheese sandwich norm), Lunch: I gave myself some flexibility but just tried to make good choices, dinner: chicken cesar salad, or fish with a bunch of veggies. Basically did this consistantly 6 days a week for 10 months and here I am. I recently took a break from my diet to enjoy BBQ season. Weight stayed steady within a 5 lb range for several months now and I am content eating smaller portions than I historically would have otherwise.

My most recent ex, who I was with for 12 years, got engaged to, and had a daughter with, cheated on me multiple times before leaving me.  While we were together, she constantly criticized me, yelled at me, and even hit me a couple of times.  I put up with it for so long because she'd been diagnosed with Bipolar I and BPD.  Allowed myself to be convinced that all of this behavior came from her mental health struggles and I stood by her.  Even read books on how to be a good/supportive partner to someone struggling from those mental health conditions.  I was the sole source of income in the house as she didn't work for most of the time we were together.  I thought I was helping her, but I was only enabling her.

Been single for three years and haven't really even felt lonely.  I just prefer to spend most of my time alone - my daughter is the only exception and her staying with me is really the only thing that I look forward to throughout the week.

I haven't decided if I'll ever date again.  I'm definitely not going to seek it out anytime soon.  The thought of potentially going through some of that pain again (though I'd walk away this time rather than just allowing myself to be treated poorly) is not something that appeals to me.

1. Key Neurotransmitters and Hormones


​Dopamine (The ""Feel-Good"" Neurotransmitter):


​This is the star of the show, heavily involved in the brain's reward system.
​When you see, hear from, or think about the girl, dopamine levels surge, creating intense feelings of euphoria, pleasure, and motivation—similar to a natural ""high.""
​This surge reinforces the desire to seek out and spend time with that person, making the experience highly addictive.


​Norepinephrine (Adrenaline's Cousin):


​Also known as noradrenaline, this is responsible for the physical signs of attraction, like a racing heart, sweaty palms, flushed cheeks, and the feeling of ""butterflies"" in your stomach.
​It contributes to the energy and excitement of new love.


​Serotonin (The Mood Regulator):


​Interestingly, serotonin levels often drop in the early stages of intense love.
​This lower level of serotonin is associated with obsessive thinking about the person, similar to what is seen in Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder (OCD), which can make the girl feel all-consuming in your thoughts.


​Oxytocin (The ""Bonding"" or ""Love Hormone""):


​While more prominent in the later stages of attachment, oxytocin is released during physical intimacy like hugging, kissing, and other skin-to-skin contact.
​It promotes feelings of trust, closeness, security, and emotional bonding.


​Vasopressin (The ""Attachment"" Hormone):


​This hormone is linked to behaviors that promote long-term, monogamous relationships and pair-bonding, generating a desire to protect one's partner.


​2. Brain Regions Involved


​Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI) studies have shown increased activity in several key brain regions when a person in love looks at a picture of their partner:


​Ventral Tegmental Area (VTA): 

A central part of the brain's reward system, rich in dopamine neurons. It is highly active and releases dopamine into other pleasure centers.


​Caudate Nucleus & Nucleus Accumbens: 

These are part of the reward and motivation centers. They ""light up"" in response to the anticipation and experience of being with the person.


​3. Deactivated Brain Areas


​Equally important are the areas that show reduced activity in early love:


​Prefrontal Cortex:

 The region associated with rational thought, critical judgment, and decision-making. Its reduced activity is sometimes cited as the reason why people ""put their partner on a pedestal"" and are less likely to notice or judge their flaws (i.e., wearing ""rose-colored glasses"").


​Amygdala:

 A key structure for processing emotions, particularly fear and negative judgment. Its lower activity may be why you feel a sense of emotional comfort and security with the person, and are more open to the vulnerability of falling in love.",22,2025-09-29,05:50:14,1

Start using finasteride and minoxidil the second you notice your hair thinning or your hairline receding.

The chat was trying to find out how it was affecting her, what the symptoms were, what she was worried about and if there were any ways that me and the kids could try to make things a bit easier during this initial adjustment period.

Then I followed that up with what I was worried about, how some of the uncalled for grouchiness was affecting us (I'd spoken to the kids beforehand) and we established some really simple ground rules.

I've seen menopause destroy marriages of people I know, one woman nearly ended up having 2 years off work and then came back tattooed to the nines, with a radical new haircut and just generally had jettisoned her old life.

Essentially, we're a good few months in now and seem to be doing ok. There's probably much more to come but so long as being able to have a sit down every now and then and seeing where little adjustments need to be made is a thing I've really pushed for in recent years; hopefully we can all get through it.

But from my perspective, I do believe we do have an epidemic level lack of accountability, but it’s not really due to social media, most of it is due to how different men and women are raised. How men and women express themselves differently, and how men and women problem solve differently.

Our brains work in different ways, women typically lead with emotion before rational thought, men typically lead with logic and then with rational thought.

Men’s perspectives are not typically emotional, it’s why you typically have a more objective understanding of the things you see before you than women do.

And don’t even get me started on the fact that in terms of bias, women are eight times more likely to have a negative bias toward men in general. Kind of reminds me of that video where they show the commentator asking men if they had one word to describe women what would it be, and then that proceeds to share like 10 guys say something nice about women repeatedly, and then they do the same thing for 10 women, and 80% of it is negative.

I could perhaps have gorged on take-out daily or sustained myself with baked beans on toast, however I grew up in a family obsessed with good food. So naturally I cooked for myself and have always had a well appointed kitchen. I would think it rather manly that a man can look after himself than merely needing a woman to mother him. My grandfather who was one of the manliest men to man ever was a spectacular cook.

- Being well groomed. I can't exactly go to a meeting with a client dressed in wrinkly miss-matched clothing can I? Also, the fact that I have always smelt good often made women gravitate towards me.

I was so caught off guard by the 180 that I needed answers. I'm not advocating for this, but I read through her Facebook messages, and she'd been telling her friends that she was excited to 'get back out there' and she was being sexual and flirting with a male friend she was moving in with. She told other friends and family all sorts about me, painting me black and that I was the villain. I was so broken.

Over the following year, she came back initially, as her Mum had a breast cancer diagnosis. My dumb ass comforted her and acted as the familiar safety blanket, whilst she explored what was out there. I felt like dirt as her Instagram filled up with bodybuilders and personal trainers with ridiculous physiques.

I cut her off, and got to work. Upgraded my hairstyle, got a tattoo I'm happy with, got my teeth whitened, hit the gym hard, and walked something like 10\~ hours a week.

She also would refuse to tell me what she liked. ""You should just know. It's not sexy if I have to tell you what I like.""

I would try new things, and she would not like them. She would get mad at me during sex cause she would lose ""it"" and now can't finish. She would cry sometimes cause I didn't instinctively know what she wanted when she wanted it. I tried to tell her so many times that I am unable to guess what she wants, and she has to tell me. She told me that isn't sexy.

She wanted to finish with me inside of her. The issue is that I would usually finish like 1 minute before she would. She didn't want me to wear a condom because it didn't feel as good for her.

I was also laughing about this with my wife this morning. The hardest part about being a woman is deciding on what to eat. I've often heard about how ""Meal planning"" is exhausting for wives.

I dont know what the solution is and if you crack the code let me know.

However if you have a good partner they will make time for the things you like if you make time for the things they like. They will take care of you when you're not feeling well. They will take on life's challenges with you. They will inspire you to be better than you are and hold you to a higher standard than you hold your for your self. When you question if you're worth their time they will remind you of all of the ways you're a great person. 

There are so many great quotes about what being in a relationship, a healthy relationship, is like. But one of my favorites is from bill gates when he talks about his divorce with Melinda he speaks about how a long term partner is a ""Witness to your legacy."" A long term partner knows who you are when you have nothing else and that is something you can never purchase and never fake. 

In Game of Thrones with Maester Aemon talks about why the men of the night's watch take oaths to never have wives and never father children. There is no amount of honor or glory that could ever compare to a woman's love when it's genuine and you really feel like she is in it with you. 

When you are in a committed relationship, i had a manager at my very first job who was celebrating his 20th anniversary and someone asked him for some advice and he told the office. ""... Get over your self..."" and we all had a good laugh. What he went on to explain was, when you're in a relationship you make decisions for you, for her, and for both of you. The advice established that in that pecking order you are rarely the priority and that is what makes for a lasting relationship. Recognizing that, accepting that responsibility, and even being happy to take that on makes for a lasting relationship.

In short, I lost our nice house in a great area, two cats that I adored (and preferred me!), and a breadwinner partner which was fun. I lost the vision of our future, our goals, and untainted happy memories. I lost the flawed idea of who my partner was, and the children we had waiting when we did IVF (made the mistake of naming them). I lost ""friends"" due to some pretty robust and gross lies made by my ex and a few people obsessed with being associated with her. Now I live with a roommate and no one to truly rely on or confide in (the roomie is great but there's no intimate relationship). She really destroyed my trust in people, which I'm having to rebuild. I lost a sense of inner comfort. 

I gained a lot, however. Even more confidence in myself, though that wasn't in short supply. I got to have my slut era after having been a serial monogamist. The amount of dating and casual sex with hot women has been awesome, and the sex is actually good - usually. But 42 first dates in a year, sex with at least half, making out with all but a handful. Really met some incredible and fun women. That's probably been the best part - just dating as a 30-something. 

I added via subtraction with a lot of my old friends from that group - most were honestly so boring and annoying and uninteresting. I've also made a ton of new friends. I'm throwing a party tomorrow hosting around 50 people, most of which I've met in the last year and a half. I'm finally dating someone exclusively who is hilarious, hot, and nasty in bed. 

And as a person, I've gained the realization that I am far too optimistic with my relationships. That just because I think things are good or at least fine, it doesn't mean they are (even if you're told they are), which can lead to taking things for granted. I've learned to be more outspoken and active with my relationships. I've relearned that forcing communication is most important, even if it's about things I dont want to discuss. 

With that said, I will always miss the idealized version of what I had and what could have been. I hate the person my ex became and I dont want to view her like this, and that probably hurts the most, because I adored that woman. But we grind on, folks.",5,2025-10-24,21:49:58,5

I’m sorry that you’re spending TG alone, holidays are always difficult in split custody situations. Try to find comfort in knowing that your children are at least happy, and that you’re instrumental in their happiness.

Regarding your finances, from other responses you’ve posted here it sounds like you’re determined to do the right thing by your children. That’s a huge thing, and someday you’ll be able to explain that to them.

So right now, you are an employed person. You get up each day, go to work (remotely!) and earn your way through the day to the best of your abilities. That shows a willingness to do your best no matter what.

You’re an active and participatory parent as much as possible. Your wheelchair is a silent testament to your abilities and your inabilities. That’s enough of an explanation to anyone.

You’re determined to pay as ordered, which means you’re left with less than you would otherwise have. That means you’ve made adjustments to your own lifestyle for ethical reasons. You’ve chosen to put your kids first.

You’re determined to avoid ugly court battles for the sake of your children. As someone who spent a decade being dragged around the system by an actual psychopath who was determined to torture his child and me for the sheer pleasure he derived from it, that makes you a good person in this regard.

People who speak casually of child support and court as though it’s easy and clear cut have very likely never had to deal with it. If the other party decides to be difficult the system can be played out for a very long time.

Consider this - your willingness to pay for child support without argument partly allows the new families to enjoy a better standard of living than they would if you not only didn’t pay, but also chose to drag them through deeply stressful and incredibly expensive litigation.

I know it’s not easy to do the right thing, and in the early stages it’s not always easy to see the full benefits of choking that path. But I promise you that in a decade from now you will have no regrets if you choose to continue to handle the situations by choosing to continue to do the right thing by your children.

What matters is not petty back and forth between adults. What matters is that everyone concerned focuses on the innocent children caught up in a situation they have no choice but to live in. 

People tend to forget that this is not about $$, minutes, rights or who forgot to bring the sports equipment. While those things matter, what matters most is this is the only childhood these kids will have, and it’s up to the adults to put them first and give them the best childhood possible.

My only advice is to get a parenting app such as parentingtime.com and at least use it to track expenses, calendars and documents. There’s also an awesome journal on there as well. Even if you don’t use it for litigation, you could give your children access when they’re older and let the facts speak for you.",2,2025-10-23,22:08:54,1

Especially my dad. They never let me go out with friends when I was in high school. I was in 10th grade and my dad would still walk to my school to go pick me up sometimes. Or he would make my brother go and pick me up. I remember one time I had asked them for permission to let me go out with my friends and they had said yes, I left around 11am, when it hit 3PM they called me and said that I had already been out for too long, that I need to go home. I was so annoyed and pissed. Another time I was going to leave to the gym around 5PM, my dad said it was already too late, we got in an argument but I still ended up leaving anyway. I know being a girl you’re more vulnerable to danger but it’s like damn, you can’t keep your daughter locked in the house all the time. After a while he would let me go to the gym though.

Was I brainwashed by internet?",257,FALSE,0,"MattGarcia9480","nn9smx2","For me I am a gay guy and my body preference is fit up to chubby. I like full figure mostly. But all ive told my partners is I want them to be comfortable in their own skin and I will support them. All I have asked of them is to not become skinny. And by become skinny I mean intentionally dieting to be skinny, not becoming ill and skinny as becoming ill isnt their choice. If they get ill I will be there to help take care of them. For weight within your own personal relationships is what I learned long ago is be who you are. Don't change. And by that I mean if you go on a first date if youre not a door holder then dont hold the door open. If you go out often you kinda need to keep the same energy. And for physically attractiveness if youre fat when you get together unless they have expressed otherwise they are likely into full figured built people. Example a guy I started talking to in the past was into dad bod bear built guys. When I found out I was diagnosed as prediabetic I lost a lot of weight and the guy I was talking to asked me for a Pic. I said I had lost a lot of weight but here's a Pic. He said oh, you did. And that was the end of that. He wasnt attracted to someone under 200lbs. Me, I am normally with 250+lbs guys. Ex of mine knew I like more full figure and he started telling me how big do you want me. I said youre misunderstanding where I come from and said what I mentioned that I just want him to be comfortable being himself and dont try to become a skinny stick, I want hips to grab and an ass to smack. He laughed.

So if you were with someone similar to me I am good with most any build but others that may have met you at a much lighter body weight will not be attracted at all to you when you gain weight.",2,2025-11-05,17:33:07,1

Just because he is upset doesn't mean he is childish, insecure, or 'less of a man.'

I want to mention two things.

First, sex and intimacy are special *with* a loved one. When he sees you watching someone's porn, he might start to think, 'Wow, maybe I'm not special to her anymore.'

Second, porn can be unhealthy and create unhealthy expectations. Maybe the man in the porn has a bigger penis than him, is leaner, or is taller, and this might make him start to think, 'Maybe I'm not the one she's looking for.'

I think he is sad about something that he doesn't know right now. Give him some space and talk openly with him. When you talk, the most important thing might be to reassure him that he *is* special to you and that what you see in porn doesn't change how you see him.

There are absolutely different response levels depending on attractiveness. 

I’ve had women approach me, but never thrown themselves at me. 

Probably the biggest two points to being above average, is the way people respond to me; I RARELY get clearly negative responses in my interactions… and I’ve never really had a problem getting decently attractive girls. When I was casually dating, I could get several dates in a week with a little effort.

But women are completely in the dark about the reality that for the majority of men, we literally just don’t emote the same way as women.

I cry probably once every 3 years, not because I suppress the times I want to but because I naturally do not emote that way. My gf told me she cries like once every 2 weeks on a good month and when I told her I cry every 3 years she assumed somethings wrong with me.

Testosterone actually creates a difference in how men experience emotion.

Something female to male transgenders who supplement with testosterone replacement therapy report is that now that they have the same T levels as a man, crying feels almost impossible and so do other emotions they used to experience a lot, and they now understand men more and realize they were completely wrong about what they believed about mens relationship with their emotions.

Another interesting fact: high estrogen leads to more negative emotions.

There’s even articles out there I’ve seen trying to market menopause claiming there’s benefits to it for career women in their 50s because now they’re more resilient to stress.

Search everything I said up for yourself.

Some object to this testosterone thing I mentioned by mentioning how when males are little boys they cry just as much as girls.

But this change happens during puberty where we get our Testosterone.

Why you see a shift in how boys emote during puberty isn’t because “pressures of masculinity” but literally our emotions have changed due to hormones",5,2025-11-05,12:57:05,2

Watching sports...it's as entertaining as unscripted reality can be. Guys are competitive. Always have been, always will be. And it's great to see people compete at the highest level. Especially when it's a sport that I play myself, whereby I can even better appreciate the talent and athleticism on display. Furthermore, professional sports - even (read: ""especially"") American football - are FAR more cerebral than they let on. Understanding what decisions are being made on field - and whether players are successful in executing them - makes you appreciate it even more.

At the risk of a gross generalization, guys tend to enjoy side-by-side company (doing the same thing together) versus face-to-face company. To that end, supporting a team is a vehicle for a sense of community. Yeah it's foolish to make your happiness contingent on whether a team that does NOT directly impact your life succeeds or not, but again, guys are competitive. To project yourself into the performance of others isn't strange - it's a core tenant of a well-written protagonist in fiction.

I also appreciate that it's real. No script, no contrivance. As such, it's among the most honest forms of entertainment out there, and that's refreshing.

That's why I have fun. ~~If you want to learn to appreciate the game with your husband (which he might really appreciate), try to take it up. Then you'll have a modest, but first-hand understanding of what those players are really doing and what they're capable of. Then you may find more enjoyment as a spectator.~~

-Respects and values that I am honest with her with my feelings, while at the same time acknowledging that I am trying to be respectful of her feelings when I share mine.  This is really helpful because it makes me feel like I can be vulnerable with her, and I recognize that a relationship can only be as deep as both people can be vulnersble eith each other.


-Frequently gives me physical touch.  This makes me feel relaxed, appreciated, and loved.  She doesn't say ""thank you"" often with her words (though sometimes she does).  It is giving me something I want like physical touch that she communicates ""I appreciate all the hard work you do for our family"".  


-To go along with the last point, she also frequently initiates sex.  I realize that most women are not like this, so my wife is a bit unique in this category, but I recognize how rare that is and appreciate her willingness to offer herself to me.  To me, sex is primarily about connection and yes, through that, we procreate.  And yes it feels great!  But connection is what I want with her, and I make it a point to thank her when she offers.


-There are many, MANY more things she does for me, but I'll list one more major one.  Her and I regularly spend time together doing something we both enjoy.  For us,that is board games, card games, and video games.  Sometimes we like to watch rom coms, detective/mystery shows, police activity shows, and action movies.

And I couldn’t go anywhere without throwing up, to the point where I had to keep a Tupperware with a lid in my car at all times because I couldn’t even get to a red light to open a door. I would have to puke in the Tupperware and close it then go into work and dump it and rinse it out and put it back in my car. It was fucking terrible and the first pregnancy is the hardest on your body as your round ligaments are stretching out and your literal bones are separating and widening in your pelvis. After that, they don’t go back into place ever again so the second pregnancy, while still so hard, doesn’t involve as much intense round ligament pain as your bones have already shifted.

Thank you for trying your best, she will hopefully feel better in a few weeks time. You care deeply and are adapting quickly and I commend you for that. I wish I had that support when I was pregnant! A little empathy goes a long way. 

I will say, not every husband does the same let alone anything at all. Their life doesn’t have to change really until the baby comes but our lives change the second we pee on a stick. Our body is not our own, and it’s extremely scary and unfamiliar in the first pregnancy. She might feel like any refusal to help is a harbinger for the rest of your lives, to which maybe once you get established at an OBGYN they can refer to a counselor or therapist.

There are resources for victims of sexual assaults and other crimes. You should look into what your local community has for victims. There are often state programs as well. They can help in a lot of ways and the resources are for ANYONE who has survived an assault. When I was getting help from one there were just as many men getting help as women, especially for the legal side of things. 

I'm so sorry this happened to you. I'm so glad to see in the comments you are getting help through therapy. Therapy helped me SO MUCH. It took me a couple tries to find a good match but someone who specializes in trauma/PTSD is always my recommendation. I did EMDR and it made a huge difference very quickly but it was VERY draining to do. 

I never was able to do anything regarding pressing charges for the sexual assault either. I hadn't realized it was what it was until all the evidence was gone and time had passed. On that bit I just want to say it's okay that you didn't do anything. Oftentimes trying to procure charges against them results in additional trauma though I can understand wanting to pursue them for so many reasons. What matters now is that YOU ARE SAFE. Stay away from the person that did this to you. Have a plan for if you bump into them somehow. Have safe people who know your history that you can go to if needed. Your safety and well being is your #1 priority and that's how it should be. In those moments, you did what you had to do to get safe and recover. 

I am glad you are safe now. May peace and healing come your way. 

The finances stuff sucks too but just take things piece by piece, one step at a time. It WILL get better. Focus on the small things you can do now for better tomorrows and things will be okay

If your looking for it you're not going to find it, and if you think you have, you haven't. Love is not how you feel when you're around someone. That is getting high off of a person, and that high will not persist over the long run. People are not drugs, so don't mistake them as such. Know what your values are and make sure they align with your partners. Know what your attachment style is, know what your love languages are, know your personality type, your Ennegram number, your boundaries, read everything by Gottman, learn the art of communication, deal with your core wounds and trauma, master the art of apology, and never stop exploring your inner world. Take notes, journal, express your inner world as it is through an art. Be brutally honest with yourself. Do the hard thing. Do not hesitate to correct yourself if you find that you have made a mistake. Everything you want is on the other side of fear. You must not dump from your glass into theirs, nor expect them to do this for you. The two glasses must be full, and the overflow be what is shared. The shape of the glass with change, so make sure you appreciate and have gratitude for that which fills it. Be accountable for your actions and have integrity. Most of all, be the partner for yourself that you would seek externally. No one can make you happy other than yourself, and when you can share that happyness freely with the world, that is the thing. ",44,2025-11-01,16:23:53,1

In other words, ""let's take it slow, have fun, don't get caught up with expectations too early, and see if this becomes something.""  That should be pretty clear and is, in my opinion, a very mature way to approach things.  Also, sometimes women (and people in general) say they just want short-term fun, and some men don't see why they should exclude a woman just because that's how she feels *right now*.  Most people don't actually have ""goals"" and change their minds based on circumstance.  Listing ""long-term relationship + fun, casual dates"" leaves the door open for ladies who don't happen to want exactly what the guy wants at the very moment.

Although I'm sure there are *some* men out there who dangle the long-term relationship thing as a carrot on a stick in order to just have casual fun, most of the time we're being realistic.  The vast majority of men don't actually have female suitors lining up to get with them, and turning down all women who aren't long-term minded means shrinking one's dating pool significantly.

She was not entirely happy apparently. She is internally not a joyful person and carries a lot of intermittent anger. So we went to couples counseling. The therapist pointed out that I was doing almost all of the work in the relationship. She would have to work on herself if we were going to improve. That did not sit well with her. 

The therapist would ask her questions like, “After you did [insert something selfish], did you consider how that would make your husband feel?” The blank look on her face and brief moment of introspection said it all. She rarely thought about me other than someone that usually could keep her happy.

Per her request, we went to a different therapist that made the same exact conclusions. My wife is a bit of a narcissist and has difficulty taking criticism or accountability for her actions. 

To deflect from herself, she would make wildly incorrect assumptions. When I would say something benign, she would take it as personal attack. I would say X and her rebuttal would be, “Yes you said X, but what you REALLY meant was Y, Z, Q, F, D… and that was hurtful.” Somehow that made me the bad person and her a victim. Classic gaslighting.

She justified leaving by saying she had been unhappy for years and I should have known despite her not telling me there is a serious problem. There was no indication. 

I think she realized she was not a very good partner. Then she would get in her own head, punish herself for not being a good partner, and make herself feel even worse. Rather than working on improving herself or the relationship she blamed me and rage quit the marriage.

Sadly I have never been as happy as when we were together. She is not perfect obviously, but I loved her completely. Most of the time we got along great.

Sex is part of what keeps a relationship on good terms and is hormone driven incentive to human mating.

There is no amount of points you can save up on the human success card to qualify for one free love or companionship with purchase of a large soft drink.

What you are entitled to is the prerogative to live your life in a way that, provided it does not harm others, brings you joy and fulfillment. And when you are a person who is able to experience joy and fulfillment *without* having another person be the battery that powers it, that's when you will be attractive to others.

No prospective partner wants to be responsible for your happiness. They want you to be happy and they want to share that happiness with you. At which point it becomes a choice, not a responsibility. I choose to do everything in my power to make my wife happy, not because she needs it but because she deserves it. If I felt like I was burdened with her emotions instead of reveling in them, I would be miserable. That's codependency. That's unhealthy.

So your first step here is to get it out of your mind that there is a threshold you need to cross to earn love. That's bullshit. Get yourself to a state where you experience joy. And make sure you don't require a partner to make that happen. That's when you'll be attractive.

I'm not a man but I hope you don't mind me answering. My man was in a very similar position to you when we started dating and now he has a whole skincare routine haha.

As you've said, you want to start simple. There's nothing worse than overloading your skin with tons of new products and ingredients! You'll most likely just purge (break out) or worse, cause irritation and damage your skin.

A good routine to start with would be as follows:

**1. Face wash/cleanser.**

Use morning and night to remove oils and sebum from your pores. Just a good way to remove grub and refresh your face! Which one will work well for you will depend on your skin type. For example gel cleansers are gentle and more moisturising; good for any skin types but especially those who want to avoid drying out their skin, e.g. people with dry skin. In contrast, foam cleansers tend to be more stripping and leave your face a lot dryer. However, they also cleanse more deeply, which is a plus for people with combo/oily/acne prone skin. CeraVe have a bunch of gel cleansers that are straightforward and simple to use. I like their Salicylic Acid gel cleanser (good for acne). They're also quite affordable and will last a long time with just one person using it.

[https://www.cerave.co.uk/skincare/cleansers/sa-smoothing-cleanser](https://www.cerave.co.uk/skincare/cleansers/sa-smoothing-cleanser)

**2. Toner**

Essentially just a watery liquid that you slap on your face whilst it's still damp from washing. It helps to balance out your skins PH and also adds moisture. Toners can also have other active ingredients in too which can be helpful, although their concentration will be much less than serums which are more targeted treatments.

**3. Serum**

Which one works for you will really depend on your skin concerns and what you want to focus on. That being said, all serums will help by adding extra moisture to your skin; this is really helpful in winter and cold weather when your skin dries out quickly. It essentially adds more plump to your skin.

If your focus is hydration, look at hyaluronic acid. If it's dark spots/acne scars look at niacinamide or azelaic acid. If it's general brightening, vitamin C (niacinamide works here too). Retinol/Retinal is talked about a lot for its anti-aging properties, but I would stay very clear of it as a beginner. It can be strong and damage your skin; wait until you're more 'experienced' lol.

**4. Moisturiser**

Just a good ol' simple moisturiser will ensure your skin stays nice and smooth. I'd recommend these two from CeraVe. It's marketed as a body cream but you can use it on your face just fine. Both formulas are nice and hydrating. The light blue one (smoothing cream) is a bit thicker and more expensive than their standard navy pot one so maybe try their original first and see how you like the texture.

[https://www.cerave.co.uk/skincare/moisturisers/sa-smoothing-cream-pot](https://www.cerave.co.uk/skincare/moisturisers/sa-smoothing-cream-pot)

**5. Sunscreen**

For use every day, even when it isn't looking sunny. A lot of people seem to think that if there are clouds in the sky, then there is no risk of skin damage. Completely false! UV rays will get you whenever you are out. Sun damage is the number 1 cause of premature skin aging; wrinkles, etc. Make sure you wear it!

**IMPORTANT:**

When trying new products, always introduce them one at a time. Start using it gradually, say twice a week, and then every day. It will help your skin adjust and you can see whether it is working for you or not, i.e., any adverse reactions. I feel this more applies to serums as opposed to gentle cleansers and simple moisturisers though. Just try the products and see how you get on.

**Re haircare:**

Obviously genetics plays a big part in people's hair/balding, etc. I oil my hair when I can and can definitely say that it has made a difference. Not only have I grown more hair, but the thin baby hairs I had have grown out. Don't bother buying pre-made rosemary oils; they're too expensive for the volume. Just make your own. Get some castor oil and add a few drops of rosemary essential oil. It'll last you ages and you can actually control the amount of active product (rosemary). Castor oil is quite thick though so maybe it might feel a bit uncomfortable.

How to use: literally just get the oil and put it on your head lmao. You can do your whole head or just areas you want to grow more; e.g. widow's peak, let's say. Obviously don't add too much so that it's dripping down your face (although this does naturally happen with gravity lol; just wipe it back), just add enough to cover the area and massage with your hands for a few minutes. I normally leave it on for a few hours maybe before washing really well, e.g. 2 times since castor is sticky.",2,2025-10-30,15:23:10,5

Guys, I want you to know that it is okay if you can't just be friends with someone you've fallen in love with.  It's okay.  The world wants you to feel like a bad person because you are incapable of burning up the feelings you have for someone and being okay with just being friends.  

It sucks, but 99% of the time if you've fallen for someone the friendship is over already, whether you shoot your shot or not.  You're not going to do great watching them fall in love with someone else.  The very best case scenario has you pining after them, never getting closure, but bottling it all up inside so you can be the ""good guy""... all the while you're missing out on good relationships you could be having.  Worse cases involve getting bitter or resentful.  In either case this is no longer a good relationship for you.

If you've fallen in love with someone you **need** to find out if they might love you back.  And if they don't you aren't a bad person for walking away and distancing yourself from them.  You're recognizing the fact that your feelings don't magically vanish.  You can't make them evaporate and just be a hang-out companion.  And you shouldn't be asked to.  Maybe with time and distance things can cool down but that's rare too.  

You need to shoot your shot.  If that ends the friendship that's okay.  It'll give you closure and the ability to move on, finding other people you are romantically compatible with.  Hanging around in her orbit to ""Stay friends"" and ""Not risk it"" isn't healthy for anybody and almost always ends poorly.",20,2025-10-31,15:24:29,1

If shes willing, have her reduce her carbohydrate consumption as much as possible. Some women have found excellent relief by going low carb/keto. 


If shes resistant, try to get her to try one at a time. I suggest the Calcium to start. Its common and good for women due to accelerated bone loss at peri age. Ive seen some women ""cure"" the terrible mood changes they experience with that alone. 


 It'll be a process, but it could save yours and hers happiness. It saved ours.

Never went to the movie because we talked for hours. Got back to my place so she could head back home. Another respectful kiss this time on the lips was followed by more talking/laughing, another kiss, laughing and more talking. Because it was cold out I suggested we at least get back in my car so we could sit. Within minutes we were necking like teenagers. It went on till 4 in the morning before she left.

I said this once to a woman I had a serious class difference with. as in she's wealthy (comes from wealth) and I'm not. and I just didn't want to deal with that to be honest. it was always going to be an uphill battle. if you know you know.


and I didn't say it, but I thought it about another woman who had a lot of desirable qualities... but tended to think rather highly of herself. she had multiple degrees from top schools, which she earned because she was very intelligent of course... but her career and her education and her success were such a huge part of her personality that I found it off-putting. I'm also highly educated, I have a good career, I'm fairly successful. those qualities didn't bother me, I was attracted to that in her. but the dynamic felt uncomfortable, it felt like on some level I was always in a job interview.


my conclusion with the second woman was that she's only going to be happy with someone who meets all of her criteria in a very specific way. and I might actually meet them to be honest... but I don't want to date someone whose criteria I have to meet, or have to worry about meeting. I find it exhausting. also to be completely honest, if I made a similar list of criteria, she wouldn't meet it in some ways. but the difference is that I don't have a set of rigid criteria that I ask women to meet.

I just came out of a relationship advice thread (unfortunately now deleted) being downvoted to oblivion because a guy asked how he could deal with his wife doing things that are clearly emotional and verbal abuse, and the vast majority of replies were along the lines of, ""Is she menopausal?"" - as if this is a natural response to hornonal changes - and badgering him about what he must have done to drive her to treating him this way.

Like, imagine if a woman said, ""My husband refuses affection, gives me the constant silent treatment, will literally yell at me for asking how my day was"" and the responses were, ""Well, did you suck his dick enough? Bring him peace? Did you ever offer sex or are you only seeking affection that doesn't lead to anything? Are you doing enough housework?""

As in no, you’re not even allowed to defend yourself or your children with anything that could be considered violence.

The laws are stupid! In some areas if a woman hurts herself attacking you, you go to jail. Not only that your reputation and thus livelihood gets ruined. It gets out that you’re a wife beater, even justified, even in self defense and you lose your job, your friends and even your family is likely to turn their backs on you.

Hurting women or children puts you at the lowest of the low, a true coward, weakling, scum. Western culture has gotten so gynocentric, so misandrist that if a woman attacks you, unless you got it on camera that it’s not, “you [must’ve] had it coming,” and sometimes even then you’ll get “what did he do to her before the cameras were rolling?” like women can’t just be vile psychos too. So defending yourself from a woman is basically dodging accountability, refusing to accept what you deserve. 

Just because you are capable of defending yourself physically doesn’t change it from the same dynamic you’re talking about in your experience. Yeah she can’t beat me up but that doesn’t mean fighting back is fruitful. She may not take me down, but she’ll cry to the authorities, to the public, and what I’ll get in return is way more damaging than a black eye.

The average woman is not interested in the average guy and would rather shoot outside her league then get treated badly or be alone instead. As a good example ask yourself how often do you see a fat woman with a skinny or athletic guy? Now ask yourself how often do you see a fat guy with a skinny woman? Basically never right?

My overweight and below average looking women friends can go on 3 dates a week without even trying but the average guys I talk to tell me they go on one date a year that never goes anywhere. 

What finally broke me on women after multiple experiences was dating a woman for awhile and starting to develop feelings for her and she tells me things like she loves how nice I am to her and how good I treat her. I help her with stuff and help her improve herself lose weight get a job work on her confidence tell her she is beautiful and that I believe in her etc. She breaks up with me to date a guy that was known to have abused his past girlfriends and shows up a couple weeks later at my work with obvious injuries. I ask her what the fuck because obviously I still cared about her and was not over her and you know what she tells me? It is okay because he is hot. 

Women do not give one fuck about anything but looks and money. They do not care how you treat them, they do not care about your personality, they do not care that you are loyal, they do not care about you or who you are. I am so sick of women friends sitting crying to me about getting treated badly assaulted or worse but then sticking with these guys or  keep going after the same kinds of guys because  they only care about looks or money. Meanwhile my guy friends who are good guys are lonely as hell. One guy I knew was such a nice guy that he attended church every week and delivered meals on wheels to lonely seniors then sat and talked to them for an hour or two because they were lonely he told me he had not been on a date in I think he said  almost a decade. This is a normal looking dude with a decent job that is obviously a really great caring guy.

> - Speed dating only works if you are the most attractive guy in the room: Going speed dating and expecting better results than online dating does not work. Met many lovely people that night, but still the guy with the best looks had girls lining up to get his number at the bar when the other 15 of us just kind of stood around.

That mirrors the experience I and other guys had and it is why some people I know that tried to organize dating events gave up. If you have an event with an even 20 men 20 women then 1 will go for a random guy, 4-10 will go for no one, and 10-15 or more will all go for the hottest guy in the room that is also typically the richest. If that guy doesn't show up they will leave the location entirely during it, wander off to go flirt with a hot guy at the bar or the bartender, or if he doesn't show up then they all pick no one and bitch and complain to the organizer about it.  


> - Online dating is broken, that does not mean you are broken: Just because you do not get matches does not mean 100% you are chopped. I am a man who get matches on Hinge and FB dating and I can tell you, its almost impossible to hold a conversation with people these days. 

Yup women have zero conversation skills and expect you to put in all the effort. Meanwhile they are talking to multiple guys at once and just pick whoever is the hottest/richest looking among them. You are nothing but free  entertainment for them and they view you like a dancing monkey that also has to provide them money.

>Well, now I can respond quickly and confidently: ""She might be a blogger who rejects me and then writes online how she thought I was a creep. The story gets picked up by feminist bloggers, and then by anti-feminist bloggers who use it as an example of what is wrong with the feminists, until eventually three or four large subcultures are debating it simultaneously. It snowballs until it gets its own its own Wikipedia entry and then a competing Conservapedia entry explaining exactly what was wrong with the Wikipedia entry and which incidentally is longer than Conservapedia's article on God meaning that my failed attempt to ask this one woman out is literally a bigger deal than the all-powerful creator of the Universe. It is welcomed into the realm of Official Scandals by being granted its own -gate suffix, and a Google search for it turns up 13900 results, including the biography of the girl I asked, the twitter hashtag relating to my rejection, and the one year retrospective. Hundreds of rape threats ensue. Richard Dawkins takes a break from being one of the world's leading public intellectuals to get involved. And if Conservapedia is to be believed (sic), it apparently leads directly to the decline of atheism and the explosive growth of global Christianity.""

>It wasn't until I the third or fourth time I read about that scandal that I realized it had anything to do with the elevator. I think I had to read some blog's interpretation where they actually came out and said ""...and because they were in an elevator and trapped with one another, that made it really uncomfortable."" Before that, I just figured it was called ""Elevatorgate"" for the same reason that the Clinton scandal was called ""Whitewatergate"" - because the proper procedure for scandal name formation involves appending -gate to the end of the location where the scandal took place.

My point of view: farting or belching loudly on purpose is gross. But passing gas or belching is not unladylike given normal body functions. If your partner is unbothered, live your life. If he has a preference I think it’s relevant, if reciprocated.",2,2025-09-29,16:57:12,1

What typically happens is the woman's dating options open up wide because she no longer worries about commitment. GEtting a man for casual flings is trivial for most women.  While the guy in the open relationship can't get a date unless he lies about his relationship status.

And to make things even worse, even women in open relationship tend to avoid men in open relationships because it's just more drama. When a woman can easily find single men to fuck around with.

A lot of comments are supportive and that’s fair; I agree with them.

Some comments are saying that they’d prefer it if their partner reached an orgasm from their touch, and that’s fair; I agree with them as well.

I’ve been with partners that orgasm from PIV, cunnilingus, and fingers; I’d be lying if I said that their orgasms weren’t significantly more satisfying for me than someone who needed a toy. 

To answer the question of how to navigate it, for anyone who’s ego may be a little hurt by it: navigate it one day at a time. Some days it doesn’t bother me at all, while other days it can be a bit bothersome. 

There’s another comment on here that mentioned the double standards of men in heterosexual relationships having to fix whatever sexual hang ups they may have (erectile dysfunction, premature ejaculation, etc.), while having to accept and learn how to maneuver around whatever sexual hang ups their female partners have. I think that there’s some validity to it. You can choose to not have to deal with someone who needs toys, and I think any comment that doesn’t accept the nuance in it lacks empathy.

So, if you can navigate it, then do so. If you can navigate it only sometimes, then go easy on yourself and her as well. And if you don’t want to navigate it at all, then you have every right to walk away. But if you move on, don’t be surprised if you find tons of women who have the same issue.

Luckily we've always been a great team, when one person was in school or working their way up, the other would hold things down with finances. 

I would say it's important to have a savings and a partner in all of this is great too. Side-hustles and cash work are huge for staying afloat. If there's an entry-level, make sure to have a job lined up before quitting. Night-courses or online  courses are great for even just picking up extra credits before training full time to limit the time spent tied up in education.

My advice? Don't approach trying to get women to like you and dont approach trying to minimize rejection. Those are bad metrics and bad goals.

Instead, approach to get to know her like a human being which makes you more unique/memorable since most guys are treating her like an object or someone they need to impress.

It doesn’t seem like you respect yourself, your husband, or the effort that you both have put into life. I strongly recommend you start a daily gratitude journal.

1. Men fundamentally are getting tired of the cat and mouse game
2. Wanting to submit is not healthy in the context of an entire relationship.
3. Saying you don’t have issues getting dates just comes off as one of two things. Either your trying to convince me that you are or you are and your just an asshole who thinks that attractive people equals good partners
4. The type of men you go after is important aswell, same goes with men and their type of women( speaking strictly of hetri relationships.) 
5. Men are told not to talk about their feelings and depending on the context of the conversation could have actually been them being vulnerable to you in attempt to bond.
6. In the traditional dynamic of what you are describing as your ideal is very old school to put it nicely. You are going to want to find a religious man and that comes with a different set of issues 
7. What you’re describing isn’t love it’s the stage before love what’s called the chasing stage. 
8. As a personal anecdote I will say this, I was raised by a single mom and because of that grew up in romcoms and dramedies. I am a romantic at heart but until I’m 100% confident that the other person is on the same level as me ( what we want from eachother and the fact that we’re both monogamous) I’m not busting out my special tricks. This means all the romantic stops are in hold until I feel it’s worth investing my energy. 

I’m not every man nor am I likely the type you are looking for for a perspective from but all the points until 8 are provable facts with a little research and hard truths. 

If you want to find someone who is romantic here is my best advice. Realize that romance is a two way street even when “submitting” and that from the sounds of it you’re not dating men who are working on themselves. It’s been two years since my last relationship and I just now feel ready to try again without any thoughts of my ex. 

Overall if you’ve made it this far all I can say is reevaluate your wants because if you were my little sister I’d say your not valuing yourself enough and you need to take the time to sift through what you claim is lots of men and find one that’s a little more  emotionally mature.

There are fathers I know who were far more involved but got stuck with a man-hating woman judge who, even with photo and video proof that the MOTHER was dating and fucking a REGISTERED child sex offender, still saw the father as the least safest person for the child to be with.

> And that only happens if you are making more than she does.

Incorrect. You can make LESS than she does and still be forced to pay. Ability to pay is only PART of the equation. It's about how much the court decides is required to support the child then they determine how much you are required to pay from that.

In addition to that, more often than not, when the father does get custody, the mother is not required to pay.

It's only been recently (think the last decade or so) that involved fathers have been given ANY kind of possible respect regarding custody. The courts, my default, assume the mother is the better caregiver and should have the child/ren. Fathers MUST fight for it, women are GIVEN it. And when fathers look at the costs, time, and impact it will have on the child/ren compared to the most likely outcome of losing regardless, it's better for the CHILD/REN to not fight UNLESS they request to be with the father.

It's not that father's don't fight for their children, it's that most are fighting with their kids best interests at heart while the women are generally fighting for a bigger pay check.

The problem comes if during arguments she's *only* reacting, getting caught up in *her* emotions, and not actually hearing you and reflecting on her side of things, which is what it sounds like. Unless you're being a much bigger dick in these arguments than it sounds like you are nd this is a reaction to that.


>I feel like im in her relationship, not in our relationship.


Bits like this make me feel like she maybe has a very stereotypical view of relationships and marriage is just something you do eventually. Can't really say without knowing her or more background, but thats the initial feeling I get from your description of things. Also not a fan of her accusing you of fucking up a good thing, instead of again, stating how she actually feels like an adult, in the midst of you saying it's *not* an entirely good thing. That reeks of manipulation. But it's also not clear how clear you're being, so I suggest you really jot down actual points as to *why* you feel something is wrong, that it's her relationship not both of yours. 


As far as getting back to emotional safety, I think that's going to require her explaining herself and her reaction so you can even decide if it's worth it.

Grannie was a stereotypical wealthy WASP.  She was broke, but she still remembered being very wealthy, and continually her granddaughter's head with stories of wealth and privilege that the grandmother had enjoyed all her life, but which were completely foreign to the granddaughter.

And that's when I entered the picture. I was a tall, good looking, self-sufficient but blue collar young man. We hit it off and had a torrid affair. Mind you, this girl was a genuine beauty. Like Grace Kelly beautiful. 

I was completely smitten. When I started talking about long term plans, I soon found out that while her parents both adored me and thought I was a great catch, her grandmother would never accept me (an Irish Catholic, blue collar guy).  And that's how I found out there was no future for us, not matter how well we had hit it off, nor how well we related.

Personal trauma (on both sides) makes it hard and then add in all the bs, the games, ridiculous standards and pathological independence. 

It’s good to be independent, able to manage on your own, but if you want a partner, you’ve got to be a partner. Every boundary and standard she has that I don’t necessarily like she either doesn’t live up to herself or won’t abide by. 

Take for example texting, so many refuse to text first, ever, or will expect you to wait hours for a response, but if you don’t text then it’s “what were you doing/who were you with that’s more important?” Or she blows up my phone like it’s an emergency. If I go for some me time, she feels sad and left out, but since everyone needs me time, I’ve got to just suck it up or something when she goes out. I’m expected to support her, but if I need anything “you’re a grown man” type energy. It’s all very one sided. I’m sure there are a whole lot of dudes who move that way too, but you’re just asking for my side.

I’m expected to take her as she is, flaws and all, while I’d better be next to perfect by comparison. My traumas better be healed, my issues under control, all the while she can do, say and act anyway she wants. Just… no. 

I’d love to have a partner, but I’m not going to settle down with anyone that doesn’t make my life better, that isn’t worth the effort. I’m not a 20 something anymore you can’t make me fall for you with just sex, nor will I stick around, hitch my horse to your wagon if that’s all you bring to my life especially being that sex does fall off as the relationship continues. Eventually I only get it when she feels like it, and better never say no when she does and I don’t or we’re having the “you’re cheating, think I’m ugly, don’t love me anymore” fight. 

What I’m looking for in a woman: one that I find moderately attractive, at this point just don’t be fat. That is kind, honest, loyal, and gives as much as she expects to get. Relationships take a division of labor, both emotional and physical (financial falls under the physical to me), and while they’re rarely in same amounts, they need to be in same proportions.

Set up your systems so that fitness is part of your routine, versus something you have to pursue. Sometimes that means ADDING friction into your life to make fitness more appealing.

For instance, I have a gym I can walk 15 minutes to from home. I also have home workout equipment. But there is a gym near my workplace. I work out in the evenings after all my work is done. 

I joined my gym at work, and then the equation is now “do I drive an hour home, then evaluate whether I have the energy to workout? Or do I walk 3 minutes to the gym, skip rush hour and drive 40 minutes home after my workout?” That’s an easy choice… the gym is always the choice.

Another thing is accountability. Set a goal that is attainable but stretches you slightly. Then commit to sending an accountability buddy your progress. Having someone else to hold you accountable helps motivate you to keep your promises to yourself. Then stay on top of them. No shame is allowed. You have to explain your successes and your failures. You’re allowed to fail in any given week. You’re just not allowed to give up. 

For me, I have a 4x/week exercise goal, and before I had my accountability partner, I was maybe hitting 2x/week because I exercised when I felt like it on that day. Now, I have to plan my weekly workouts in my calendar in advance to ensure that I’m hitting my goals.

And how has it been going?",55,FALSE,8,"Brown_90s_Bear","njioulr","Really depends on the relationship and the circumstances. My advice is just to find what works for you both.  Think you have the right idea, in that overall the split should be 50/50 but depending on the category, it may be skewed toward one person over another.

For me, I make 3x my partner but also work 1.5x her hours. So I take the majority of the financial burden, while she manages the majority of our personal responsibilities.

So financially, I pay 3/4 of our expenses.  What that looks like is I cover the mortgage/rent, insurance (my company also has better insurance), most major purchases (car, appliances, etc.) + my personal expenses.  She covers our living expenses (groceries, home maintainence \[including handyman/landscapers, etc\]) + her personal expenses.  We both have emergency funds, mine is bookmarked for any major expenses / if one of us loses our job), hers is for more simple unexpected expenses (car/home maintenance & repairs, simple medical, etc). We both also have independent investment accounts (since we both have an interest and existing accounts). O I also cover any group meals/entertainment (but more for society than anything else). When we have kids, this will likely stay the same, though I would pick up school expenses (daycare, tuition, etc) and she would pick up clothing, hobbies / interests, social events etc.

Responsibilities-wise, as I mentioned, she picks up the groceries, but we both split cooking food since we both enjoy cooking.  In our house, the person who cooks doesn't clean the kitchen, so whoever cooks that night dictates that.  Otherwise, she cleans/maintains/manages the house (including laundry) mostly, and I do the handyman work (building furniture, simple home/car maintainence / repairs).  She also manages our families, our collective social calendar (though we both also have our own independent social lives as well).  Obviously, there is flexibility for all the above but in general, that's the breakdown.

One thing I would also like to highlight is decision-making.  So obviously, while I cover all our major expenses, all major decisions are made collectively.  If there is a major purchase I want to make that she doesn't agree with, that comes out of my personal expenses, and vice versa.  That being said, decisions on the work front are a bit more skewed toward me since the majority of our collective salary comes from me.  For instance, we both had a company event a few months back on the same night, so she attended mine and skipped hers.  On the home front, she typically gets decisions skewed in her favor.  For instance, I didn't really like the landscaper, but since she would be the one managing them, she made that decision.

In terms of kids, since I often work late, we plan that I will spend time with them in the morning before I leave, and she will manage their days and evenings.  Weekends, we plan on obviously spending them together, but will allocate relatively alternating weekends for independent social events.  We both plan on being actively involved in their development and plan on following relatively traditional roles there.  Think my brother put it best, in that she will protect and nurture them, and I will prepare them for the world.",3,2025-10-14,21:32:30,24

I already knew she was a keeper but my family didn’t take to her at first and really behaved terribly, saying mean things and calling her a gold-digger among many things. So my girl would just visit me quietly at my place or I’d go to hers.

One birthday (mine), she knew my folks wanted to make a bit of a fuss but she said she didn’t want to cause any bother. My folks wanted to do a BBQ at my little condo complex. My girl cheerfully helped me plan it all. We got the food, cleaned the grills, set things up. And she then took my car, smiled and waved, telling me to have a good time with my family. And before she left, she kissed me and told me to just leave all the stuff to be cleaned till she got home. 

The party went on till a bit after midnight. The whole time I taught what a loser I am to be here and let her go find someplace else to kill time while she waited for the party she planned to be over. She wound up sitting in a (safe) parking lot for an hour after the malls closed until I texted her to let her know everyone had left a bit before 1am.

She walked in all smiles, not a frown or grunt, asked how it went and proceeded to a help me clean up and was at it till 3:30am, giving the community grill a sparkling makeover in the process. 

If I had any doubts about marrying this woman at all, they evaporated faster than that grill could shine again. 

I told my Mom this story a few weeks later, and how I had never felt so loved by anyone. Every time my girl left, she also left my fridge stocked with food she had cooked (I had insane deadlines and she wanted me to eat well even if I didn’t have time) Mom melted and asked me to invite my girl to dinner and things improved dramatically after. 

Now Mom keeps telling me how lucky I am to be with my wife. I always knew it. We met when things weren’t great in our lives but she showed up for me, and when her Dad had several bouts of cancer, I was there for her to help him with every doctor visit, change of bedpan and anything else needed.

The biggest downside for me was sometimes having women I was genuinely interested in assume I was some douchebag player who only wants to sleep with them.  Wasn't a huge problem though as once they got to know me, in most cases they could see I wasn't what they thought I was.  My ex-fiancee even told me straight up that when she met me, she thought I was a ""player"", but when she actually talked to me for a bit, she realized I was a genuinely nice person.

The other thing, which may be unique to me, is that I was very insecure about the way I looked.  The whole reason I was even in the shape I was in, why I kept up with my appearance the way I did, etc., was because I was insecure.  I was already a decent looking guy, in decent shape as well, but after a girl I was with for over two years suddenly seemed to lose interest in me, I studied every single flaw I had and convinced myself that she must have been just *disgusted* with me - so I started working out twice a day, seven days a week.  Stopped drinking beer or eating junk food of every kind.  Made sure I was perfectly groomed at all times.  You get the idea.  I changed my entire lifestyle - and while I was in the best shape of my life, it wasn't really a fun way to live.  I also found that once I'd addressed the entire list of things I was insecure about, I magically came up with an entirely new list of things to be self conscious over.  It was just a vicious cycle, and I relied on that validation from women to sort of keep me from completely hating myself.

I was told all the time that I was good looking.  I had women I'd never even seen before coming up and putting their hands on me at bars.  I never had to make any real effort to meet them, but I still thought very little of myself and often felt nervous that if they got too close, got too good of a look, or got to know me too well, they'd be disgusted with me like my ex was.  

That was one of the things I had to address and work through in therapy a few years later while I was being treated for depression.  Years have gone by and now I'm perfectly happy just being a regular-ass dude.  I don't need people to think I'm the best looking guy in the room anymore.  I live my life the way I want to.  I'm still thin but I don't walk around with six pack abs and bulging muscles anymore.  My hair is messy sometimes and I occasionally let my beard grow out a bit wild.

I don't really have any good advice about handling rejection as I almost never put myself in a position to get rejected - because I have a pretty big fear of rejection.  My sense of self-worth is pretty fragile.  My whole life, I've almost exclusively dated women that approached me and expressed interest first.

Try not to let it get to you.  Sounds like you have a lot going for you and shouldn't have too many problems meeting someone new.  It's not as if you had nothing of interest to this girl since she had a good date, some physical activity, etc. with you.

Think about all of the things that fall under the category “adulting”. So things like 


- cooking

- cleaning

- errands

- dishes

- driving

- chores

- taking care of animals/kids

- buying necessities/luxuries (groceries/dates/supplies/etc.

- working (that includes hours worked/commute/ intensity of the job)


Now really ask yourself what percentage of each of those things you do vs them. One thing I’ve noticed in my partners is procrastination and an overall difference in when things need to happen and the living environment people are comfortable with. Which can lead to discrepancies, such as, one person hates having a half full sink whereas the other person only cares when the sink is about to overflow. The person with the lower threshold will always end up doing it more because they won’t let it get to the higher threshold. 


So if you find that ur partner is doing most of those things while working the sense amount of hours as you or a shittier job or something like that sort of equation then yeah you need to step up. It’s not supposed to be 50/50, each person is supposed to 60% the overlapping 20% is that nice relaxing time when there is nothing looming over either of you. Unfairness can kill any relationship. 


With that being said, if your partner is doing 70-100% of everything, then they also need to take responsibility for not prioritizing themself and not bring it up sooner. It sounds like
You will need to do more and more often while they need to learn to do less.

It's possible to cheat on someone even when you're having a great marriage and are deeply in love. Watch the talks on YouTube by Esther Perel. She explains really well that cheating doesn't have to be because of a lack of desire, a drinking problem or any other reason.

Humans are just very bad at monogamy. When you realise that monogamy is a recent social construct that overlays hundreds of thousands of years of biological conditioning, it helps explain why we're all so bad at monogamy. We were not designed to only have eyes for one person and only one person forever and ever. We can aspire to it for a myriad of reasons, either loyalty, morality, or whatever you want to call it but for some reason across hundreds of cultures, this seems to be the one thing people fail at miserably.

The auction preceded my dad losing his fight with cancer my 3 months.

How did I fight the depression:  Since I no longer had a farm or a company, I was unemployed and sitting on a large sum of money, I moved into the pool house at my mom and dads.  I enrolled in college to finish what I started in 1986, and I bought the Black and Decker Construction Series of books.  I had 3 acres left out of the 1100 and I built myself a house, doing it all myself except for laying the brick and I built a large shop/garage.  

How do I continue to fight the depression:  The divorce was 14 years ago but from time to time I still get depressed over investing so much in someone who did not deserve it, so I restore antique cars and trucks in my garage.  So far I have restored a 1966 and 1972 Chevy trucks, 1973 Camaro, and currently working on a 1970 Chevelle SS.

Not in that order. I just thought about the kind of woman I wanted as a life partner. I was never interested in casual sex or one night stands even before I had a girlfriend and that has not changed since I had my first girlfriend. 

I realized that to get a woman like I dreamed of I had to become the kind of man that a woman would want to have as her husband for a long term relationship and have kids with, so I had to be careful in the choices I make and how I act around other people. I had to work on myself first.

I lost my dad 5 months before my daughter was born. He never got to meet my daughter. It destroyed me when he died. The grief crippled me for many months. And now, it’s still there, but it’s less intense and permanent but it’s still very accessible mentally.

Everyone thinks they have a good idea what every emotions are, happy, sad, etc. there may have been a time for example when they felt that specific emotion. In my experience however, people sometimes don’t know true grief. 

It comes for you whether you are “prepared” or not. Grief is the longing for something that you’ve lost and will never get back. Many people have either never experienced it or turn away from it emotionally or with vices.

The best thing I ever heard on the topic was from Jay Shetty I believe. It goes something like this: when you lose someone you don’t really get over it. It’s a stone you have to carry. There is no choice in the matter, as this stone is symbolic to your relationship with the person, however fragmented, if the love was true. And with time, that stone might still be heavy… but you become stronger… and you’re able to carry it as you move forward.

Not being successful as a man and not being taken seriously because of it. If you are a man who has not built his own empire by 25, people just write you off. It’s like being an average man is living in quiet desperation, begging for someone to recognize your existence but deep down knowing that only happens if you contribute massively to society or you were born genetically superior. At least as a woman you’ll have friends and some pathetic men to give you validation, but as a normal guy you basically live day to day in a quiet vacuum of work, home, and going out with the hope that some woman that night is bored enough to sleep with you.

It’s a burden being a man on the fringes of society. You are seen as a creep, a loser, misplaced, a danger to society. Women would rather be with a dangerous bear in the woods than a man. A man can’t be trusted around children, and is often told by women that they aren’t needed. If you don’t fit into the female paradigm of what a man is supposed to be; tall, dark, rich, handsome, you don’t even exist. I have seriously heard women say there are no good men or all men are dogs when some of my best friends have been the most loyal human beings ever. They show what their exes look like, and no surprise the men they mess with look sculpted, and very much unbothered with tons of female friends.

Everything you do as a hobby, have fun and or do becomes much harder to do. Sleep will evade you for the first while (only had 3 hours last night) and you begin to develop an ability to run perfectly normal with that much plus maybe a coffee or two. Also you become a lot less intimate with your partner (for obvious reasons) and your main focus is your baby in all aspects of your life.

However, it is worth it on a scale you can't imagine.

True we may not go out anymore, go crazy on hobbies or anything else. But spending time with your child is so rewarding, I love watching them play or starting to eat (doing that now with baby lead weaning) and having some funny faces, you become instantly concerned about everything they are doing and spend time looking at stuff for them. Whenever you are down or sad, getting a cuddle or hug from them makes it all go away. You begin to plan for all aspects of their lives and you begin to forget about going out for a drink or jumping on with the lads to play some games, they become your biggest priority or interest in your life.

Insomnia can have many causes - some psychological, like stress, anxiety or depression, others physical, including a variety of undiagnosed illnesses. 

If this has been an ongoing issue, it's worth looking at with a doctor. If you haven't already, keep track of your sleep cycles (with something like a smartwatch), so you can show your data to your doctor. Be honest about the toll it's taking on you, and be open to different approaches. Sometimes, medication can help; in other cases, it's about fixing nutrition issues (iron deficits can cause insomnia, for example). 

It's okay to need help, and it takes strength to admit that and to seek that help.
